# CompCert
The formally-verified C compiler.

## Overview
The CompCert C verified compiler is a compiler for a large subset of the
C programming language that generates code for the PowerPC, ARM, x86 and
RISC-V processors.

The distinguishing feature of CompCert is that it has been formally
verified using the Coq proof assistant: the generated assembly code is
formally guaranteed to behave as prescribed by the semantics of the
source C code.

For more information on CompCert (supported platforms, supported C
features, installation instructions, using the compiler, etc), please
refer to the [Web site](https://compcert.org/) and especially
the [user's manual](https://compcert.org/man/).
