# Note 1: finding where MenhirLib has been installed would be easier if we
# could depend on ocamlfind, but as far as I understand and as of today,
# CompCert can be compiled and linked even in the absence of ocamlfind.
# So, we should not require ocamlfind.

# Note 2: Menhir has options --suggest-comp-flags and --suggest-link-flags
# which we are supposed to help solve this difficulty. However, they don't
# work for us out of the box, because if Menhir has been installed using
# ocamlfind, then Menhir will suggest using ocamlfind (i.e. it will suggest
# -package and -linkpkg options), which we don't want to do.

# Solution: Ask Menhir first. If Menhir answers "-package menhirLib", then
# Menhir was installed with ocamlfind, so we should not ask Menhir, but we
# can instead ask ocamlfind where Menhir's library was installed. Otherwise,
# Menhir answers directly with a "-I ..." directive, which we use.
