(* The if-conversion heuristic depend on the
   -fif-conversion and -ffavor-branchless flags.

With [-fno-if-conversion] or [-0O], if-conversion is turned off entirely.
With [-ffavor-branchless], if-conversion is performed whenever semantically
correct, regardless of how much it could cost.
Otherwise (and by default), optimization is performed when it seems beneficial.

If-conversion seems beneficial if:
- the target architecture supports an efficient "conditional move" instruction
  (not an emulation that takes several instructions)
- the total cost the "then" and "else" branches is not too high
- the cost difference between the "then" and "else" branches is low enough.

Intuition: on a modern processor, the "then" and the "else" branches
can generally be computed in parallel, there is enough ILP for that.
So, the bad case is if the most taken branch is much cheaper than the
other branch.  Another bad case is if both branches are big: since the
code for one branch precedes entirely the code for the other branch,
if the first branch contains a lot of instructions,
dynamic reordering of instructions will not look ahead far enough
to execute instructions from the other branch in parallel with
instructions from the first branch.
