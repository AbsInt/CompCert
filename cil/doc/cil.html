New: CIL now has a Source Forge page: 
 <A HREF="javascript:loadTop('http://sourceforge.net/projects/cil')">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cil</A>. <BR>
<BR>
CIL (<B>C</B> <B>I</B>ntermediate <B>L</B>anguage) is a high-level representation
along with a set of tools that permit easy analysis and source-to-source
transformation of C programs.<BR>
<BR>
CIL is both lower-level than abstract-syntax trees, by clarifying ambiguous
constructs and removing redundant ones, and also higher-level than typical
intermediate languages designed for compilation, by maintaining types and a
close relationship with the source program. The main advantage of CIL is that
it compiles all valid C programs into a few core constructs with a very clean
semantics. Also CIL has a syntax-directed type system that makes it easy to
analyze and manipulate C programs. Furthermore, the CIL front-end is able to
process not only ANSI-C programs but also those using Microsoft C or GNU C
extensions. If you do not use CIL and want instead to use just a C parser and
analyze programs expressed as abstract-syntax trees then your analysis will
have to handle a lot of ugly corners of the language (let alone the fact that
parsing C itself is not a trivial task). See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-simplec">16</A> for some
examples of such extreme programs that CIL simplifies for you.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, CIL is a highly-structured, &#8220;clean&#8221; subset of C. CIL features a
reduced number of syntactic and conceptual forms. For example, all looping
constructs are reduced to a single form, all function bodies are given
explicit <TT>return</TT> statements, syntactic sugar like <TT>"-&gt;"</TT> is
eliminated and function arguments with array types become pointers. (For an
extensive list of how CIL simplifies C programs, see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-cabs2cil">4</A>.)
This reduces the number of cases that must be considered when manipulating a C
program. CIL also separates type declarations from code and flattens scopes
within function bodies. This structures the program in a manner more amenable
to rapid analysis and transformation. CIL computes the types of all program
expressions, and makes all type promotions and casts explicit. CIL supports
all GCC and MSVC extensions except for nested functions and complex numbers.
Finally, CIL organizes C's imperative features into expressions, instructions
and statements based on the presence and absence of side-effects and
control-flow. Every statement can be annotated with successor and predecessor
information. Thus CIL provides an integrated program representation that can
be used with routines that require an AST (e.g. type-based analyses and
pretty-printers), as well as with routines that require a CFG (e.g., dataflow
analyses). CIL also supports even lower-level representations (e.g.,
three-address code), see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-Extension">8</A>. <BR>
<BR>
CIL comes accompanied by a number of Perl scripts that perform generally
useful operations on code:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
A <A HREF="#sec-driver">driver</A> which behaves as either the <TT>gcc</TT> or
Microsoft VC compiler and can invoke the preprocessor followed by the CIL
application. The advantage of this script is that you can easily use CIL and
the analyses written for CIL with existing make files.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">A <A HREF="#sec-merger">whole-program merger</A> that you can use as a
replacement for your compiler and it learns all the files you compile when you
make a project and merges all of the preprocessed source files into a single
one. This makes it easy to do whole-program analysis.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">A <A HREF="#sec-patcher">patcher</A> makes it easy to create modified
copies of the system include files. The CIL driver can then be told to use
these patched copies instead of the standard ones.
</UL>
CIL has been tested very extensively. It is able to process the SPECINT95
benchmarks, the Linux kernel, GIMP and other open-source projects. All of
these programs are compiled to the simple CIL and then passed to <TT>gcc</TT> and
they still run! We consider the compilation of Linux a major feat especially
since Linux contains many of the ugly GCC extensions (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-ugly-gcc">16.2</A>).
This adds to about 1,000,000 lines of code that we tested it on. It is also
able to process the few Microsoft NT device drivers that we have had access
to. CIL was tested against GCC's c-torture testsuite and (except for the tests
involving complex numbers and inner functions, which CIL does not currently
implement) CIL passes most of the tests. Specifically CIL fails 23 tests out
of the 904 c-torture tests that it should pass. GCC itself fails 19 tests. A
total of 1400 regression test cases are run automatically on each change to
the CIL sources.<BR>
<BR>
CIL is relatively independent on the underlying machine and compiler. When
you build it CIL will configure itself according to the underlying compiler.
However, CIL has only been tested on Intel x86 using the gcc compiler on Linux
and cygwin and using the MS Visual C compiler. (See below for specific
versions of these compilers that we have used CIL for.)<BR>
<BR>
The largest application we have used CIL for is
<A HREF="javascript:loadTop('../ccured/index.html')">CCured</A>, a compiler that compiles C code into
type-safe code by analyzing your pointer usage and inserting runtime checks in
the places that cannot be guaranteed statically to be type safe. <BR>
<BR>
You can also use CIL to &#8220;compile&#8221; code that uses GCC extensions (e.g. the
Linux kernel) into standard C code.<BR>
<BR>
CIL also comes accompanies by a growing library of extensions (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-Extension">8</A>). You can use these for your projects or as examples of
using CIL. <BR>
<BR>
<TT>PDF</TT> versions of <A HREF="CIL.pdf">this manual</A> and the
<A HREF="CIL-API.pdf">CIL API</A> are available. However, we recommend the
<TT>HTML</TT> versions because the postprocessed code examples are easier to
view. <BR>
<BR>
If you use CIL in your project, we would appreciate letting us know. If you
want to cite CIL in your research writings, please refer to the paper &#8220;CIL:
Intermediate Language and Tools for Analysis and Transformation of C
Programs&#8221; by George C. Necula, Scott McPeak, S.P. Rahul and Westley Weimer,
in &#8220;Proceedings of Conference on Compilier Construction&#8221;, 2002.<BR>

<!--TOC section Installation-->

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc2">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation</H2><!--SEC END -->

You will need OCaml release 3.08 or higher to build CIL. CIL has been tested
on Linux and on Windows (where it can behave at either Microsoft Visual C or
gcc).<BR>
<BR>
If you want to use CIL on Windows then you must get a complete installation
of <TT>cygwin</TT> and the source-code OCaml distribution and compile it yourself
using the cygwin tools (as opposed to getting the Win32 native-code version of
OCaml). If you have not done this before then take a look
<A HREF="../ccured/setup.html">here</A>. (Don't need to worry about <TT>cvs</TT> and
<TT>ssh</TT> unless you will need to use the master CVS repository for CIL.)
<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
Download the CIL <A HREF="distrib">distribution</A> (latest version is
<A HREF="distrib/cil-1.3.5.tar.gz"><TT>distrib/cil-1.3.5.tar.gz</TT></A>). See the Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-changes">20</A> for recent changes to the CIL distribution.
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Unzip and untar the source distribution. This will create a directory
 called <TT>cil</TT> whose structure is explained below.<BR>
<TT>tar xvfz cil-1.3.5.tar.gz</TT>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Enter the <TT>cil</TT> directory and run the <TT>configure</TT> script and then 
 GNU make to build the distribution. If you are on Windows, at least the
 <TT>configure</TT> step must be run from within <TT>bash</TT>.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>cd cil</CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>./configure</CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>make</CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>make quicktest</CODE><BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">You should now find <TT>cilly.asm.exe</TT> in a
subdirectory of <TT>obj</TT>. The name of the subdirectory is either <TT>x86_WIN32</TT>
if you are using <TT>cygwin</TT> on Windows or <TT>x86_LINUX</TT> if you are using
Linux (although you should be using instead the Perl wrapper <TT>bin/cilly</TT>).
Note that we do not have an <TT>install</TT> make target and you should use Cil
from the development directory. 
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">If you decide to use CIL, <B>please</B>
<A HREF="mailto:necula@cs.berkeley.edu">send us a note</A>. This will help recharge
our batteries after more than a year of development. And of course, do send us
your bug reports as well.</OL>
The <TT>configure</TT> script tries to find appropriate defaults for your system.
You can control its actions by passing the following arguments:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>CC=foo</TT> Specifies the path for the <TT>gcc</TT> executable. By default
whichever version is in the PATH is used. If <TT>CC</TT> specifies the Microsoft
<TT>cl</TT> compiler, then that compiler will be set as the default one. Otherwise,
the <TT>gcc</TT> compiler will be the default.
</UL>
CIL requires an underlying C compiler and preprocessor. CIL depends on the
underlying compiler and machine for the sizes and alignment of types.The
installation procedure for CIL queries the underlying compiler for
architecture and compiler dependent configuration parameters, such as the size
of a pointer or the particular alignment rules for structure fields. (This
means, of course, that you should re-run <TT>./configure</TT> when you move CIL to
another machine.)<BR>
<BR>
We have tested CIL on the following compilers:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
On Windows, <TT>cl</TT> compiler version 12.00.8168 (MSVC 6),
 13.00.9466 (MSVC .Net), and 13.10.3077 (MSVC .Net 2003). Run <TT>cl</TT>
 with no arguments to get the compiler version. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">On Windows, using <TT>cygwin</TT> and <TT>gcc</TT> version 2.95.3, 3.0,
 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">On Linux, using <TT>gcc</TT> version 2.95.3, 3.0, 3.2, 3.3, and 4.0.
</UL>
Others have successfully used CIL with Mac OS X (on both PowerPC and
x86), Solaris, and *BSD. If you make any changes to the build
system in order to run CIL on your platform, please send us a patch.<BR>

<A NAME="sec-cabs2cil"></A>
In this section we try to describe a few of the many transformations that are
applied to a C program to convert it to CIL. The module that implements this
conversion is about 5000 lines of OCaml code. In contrast a simple program
transformation that instruments all functions to keep a shadow stack of the
true return address (thus preventing stack smashing) is only 70 lines of code.
This example shows that the analysis is so much simpler because it has to
handle only a few simple C constructs and also because it can leverage on CIL
infrastructure such as visitors and pretty-printers.<BR>
<BR>
In no particular order these are a few of the most significant ways in which
C programs are compiled into CIL:

<!--TOC section How to Use CIL-->

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc5">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Use CIL</H2><!--SEC END -->
<A NAME="sec-cil"></A><!--NAME cilly.html-->
<BR>
<BR>
There are two predominant ways to use CIL to write a program analysis or
transformation. The first is to phrase your analysis as a module that is
called by our existing driver. The second is to use CIL as a stand-alone
library. We highly recommend that you use <TT>cilly</TT>, our driver. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Using <TT>cilly</TT>, the CIL driver-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc6">5.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using <TT>cilly</TT>, the CIL driver</H3><!--SEC END -->

The most common way to use CIL is to write an Ocaml module containing your
analysis and transformation, which you then link into our boilerplate
driver application called <TT>cilly</TT>. <TT>cilly</TT> is a Perl script that
processes and mimics <TT>GCC</TT> and <TT>MSVC</TT> command-line arguments and then
calls <TT>cilly.byte.exe</TT> or <TT>cilly.asm.exe</TT> (CIL's Ocaml executable). <BR>
<BR>
An example of such module is <TT>logwrites.ml</TT>, a transformation that is
distributed with CIL and whose purpose is to instrument code to print the
addresses of memory locations being written. (We plan to release a
C-language interface to CIL so that you can write your analyses in C
instead of Ocaml.) See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-Extension">8</A> for a survey of other example
modules. <BR>
<BR>
Assuming that you have written <TT>/home/necula/logwrites.ml</TT>, 
here is how you use it: 
<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Modify <TT>logwrites.ml</TT> so that it includes a CIL &#8220;feature
 descriptor&#8221; like this: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
let feature : featureDescr = 
  { fd_name = "logwrites";              
    fd_enabled = ref false;
    fd_description = "generation of code to log memory writes";
    fd_extraopt = [];
    fd_doit = 
    (function (f: file) -&gt; 
      let lwVisitor = new logWriteVisitor in
      visitCilFileSameGlobals lwVisitor f)
  } 
</PRE>The <TT>fd_name</TT> field names the feature and its associated
 command-line arguments. The <TT>fd_enabled</TT> field is a <TT>bool ref</TT>.
 &#8220;<TT>fd_doit</TT>&#8221; will be invoked if <TT>!fd_enabled</TT> is true after
 argument parsing, so initialize the ref cell to true if you want
 this feature to be enabled by default.<BR>
<BR>
When the user passes the <TT>--dologwrites</TT>
 command-line option to <TT>cilly</TT>, the variable associated with the
 <TT>fd_enabled</TT> flag is set and the <TT>fd_doit</TT> function is called
 on the <TT>Cil.file</TT> that represents the merger (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-merger">13</A>) of
 all C files listed as arguments. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Invoke <TT>configure</TT> with the arguments
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
./configure EXTRASRCDIRS=/home/necula EXTRAFEATURES=logwrites
</PRE>
 This step works if each feature is packaged into its own ML file, and the
name of the entry point in the file is <TT>feature</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
An alternative way to specify the new features is to change the build files
yourself, as explained below. You'll need to use this method if a single
feature is split across multiple files.
<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=a><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
 Put <TT>logwrites.ml</TT> in the <TT>src</TT> or <TT>src/ext</TT> directory. This
 will make sure that <TT>make</TT> can find it. If you want to put it in some
 other directory, modify <TT>Makefile.in</TT> and add to <TT>SOURCEDIRS</TT> your
 directory. Alternately, you can create a symlink from <TT>src</TT> or
 <TT>src/ext</TT> to your file.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Modify the <TT>Makefile.in</TT> and add your module to the 
 <TT>CILLY_MODULES</TT> or
 <TT>CILLY_LIBRARY_MODULES</TT> variables. The order of the modules matters. Add
 your modules somewhere after <TT>cil</TT> and before <TT>main</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">If you have any helper files for your module, add those to
 the makefile in the same way. e.g.:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
CILLY_MODULES = $(CILLY_LIBRARY_MODULES) \
                myutilities1 myutilities2 logwrites \
                main
</PRE>
 Again, order is important: <TT>myutilities2.ml</TT> will be able to refer
 to Myutilities1 but not Logwrites. If you have any ocamllex or ocamlyacc
 files, add them to both <TT>CILLY_MODULES</TT> and either <TT>MLLS</TT> or
 <TT>MLYS</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Modify <TT>main.ml</TT> so that your new feature descriptor appears in
 the global list of CIL features. 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
let features : C.featureDescr list = 
  [ Logcalls.feature;
    Oneret.feature;    
    Heapify.feature1;  
    Heapify.feature2;
    makeCFGFeature; 
    Partial.feature;
    Simplemem.feature;
    Logwrites.feature;  (* add this line to include the logwrites feature! *)
  ] 
  @ Feature_config.features 
</PRE>
 Features are processed in the order they appear on this list. Put
 your feature last on the list if you plan to run any of CIL's
 built-in features (such as makeCFGfeature) before your own.</OL><BR>
Standard code in <TT>cilly</TT> takes care of adding command-line arguments,
 printing the description, and calling your function automatically. 
 Note: do not worry about introducing new bugs into CIL by adding a single
 line to the feature list. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Now you can invoke the <TT>cilly</TT> application on a preprocessed file, or
 instead use the <TT>cilly</TT> driver which provides a convenient compiler-like
 interface to <TT>cilly</TT>. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-driver">7</A> for details using <TT>cilly</TT>.
 Remember to enable your analysis by passing the right argument (e.g.,
 <TT>--dologwrites</TT>). </OL>
<!--TOC subsection Using CIL as a library-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc7">5.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using CIL as a library</H3><!--SEC END -->

CIL can also be built as a library that is called from your stand-alone
application. Add <TT>cil/src</TT>, <TT>cil/src/frontc</TT>, <TT>cil/obj/x86_LINUX</TT>
(or <TT>cil/obj/x86_WIN32</TT>) to your Ocaml project <TT>-I</TT> include paths.
Building CIL will also build the library <TT>cil/obj/*/cil.cma</TT> (or
<TT>cil/obj/*/cil.cmxa</TT>). You can then link your application against that
library. <BR>
<BR>
You can call the <TT>Frontc.parse: string -&gt; unit -&gt; Cil.file</TT> function with
the name of a file containing the output of the C preprocessor.
The <TT>Mergecil.merge: Cil.file list -&gt; string -&gt; Cil.file</TT> function merges
multiple files. You can then invoke your analysis function on the resulting
<TT>Cil.file</TT> data structure. You might want to call
<TT>Rmtmps.removeUnusedTemps</TT> first to clean up the prototypes and variables
that are not used. Then you can call the function <TT>Cil.dumpFile:
cilPrinter -&gt; out_channel -&gt; Cil.file -&gt; unit</TT> to print the file to a
given output channel. A good <TT>cilPrinter</TT> to use is
<TT>defaultCilPrinter</TT>. <BR>
<BR>
Check out <TT>src/main.ml</TT> and <TT>bin/cilly</TT> for other good ideas
about high-level file processing. Again, we highly recommend that you just
our <TT>cilly</TT> driver so that you can avoid spending time re-inventing the
wheel to provide drop-in support for standard <TT>makefile</TT>s. <BR>
<BR>
Here is a concrete example of compiling and linking your project against
CIL. Imagine that your program analysis or transformation is contained in
the single file <TT>main.ml</TT>. 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
$ ocamlopt -c -I $(CIL)/obj/x86_LINUX/ main.ml
$ ocamlopt -ccopt -L$(CIL)/obj/x86_LINUX/ -o main unix.cmxa str.cmxa \ 
        $(CIL)/obj/x86_LINUX/cil.cmxa main.cmx

The first line compiles your analysis, the second line links it against CIL
(as a library) and the Ocaml Unix library. For more information about

<!--TOC subsection Using the visitor-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc9">6.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the visitor</H3><!--SEC END -->
<A NAME="sec-visitor"></A>
One of the most useful tools exported by the CIL API is an implementation of
the visitor pattern for CIL programs. The visiting engine scans depth-first
the structure of a CIL program and at each node is queries a user-provided
visitor structure whether it should do one of the following operations: 
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Ignore this node and all its descendants
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Descend into all of the children and when done rebuild the node if any
of the children have changed. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Replace the subtree rooted at the node with another tree.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Replace the subtree with another tree, then descend into the children
and rebuild the node if necessary and then invoke a user-specified function. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">In addition to all of the above actions then visitor can specify that
some instructions should be queued to be inserted before the current
instruction or statement being visited. 
</UL>
By writing visitors you can customize the program traversal and
transformation. One major limitation of the visiting engine is that it does
not propagate information from one node to another. Each visitor must use its
own private data to achieve this effect if necessary. <BR>
<BR>
Each visitor is an object that is an instance of a class of type <A HREF="api/Cil.cilVisitor.html#.">Cil.cilVisitor..</A>
The most convenient way to obtain such classes is to specialize the
<A HREF="api/Cil.nopCilVisitor.html#c">Cil.nopCilVisitor.c</A>lass (which just traverses the tree doing
nothing). Any given specialization typically overrides only a few of the
methods. Take a look for example at the visitor defined in the module
<TT>logwrites.ml</TT>. Another, more elaborate example of a visitor is the
[copyFunctionVisitor] defined in <TT>cil.ml</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
Once you have defined a visitor you can invoke it with one of the functions:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilFile">Cil.visitCilFile</A> or <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilFileSameGlobals">Cil.visitCilFileSameGlobals</A> - visit a file
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilGlobal">Cil.visitCilGlobal</A> - visit a global
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilFunction">Cil.visitCilFunction</A> - visit a function definition
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilExp">Cil.visitCilExp</A> - visit an expression
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilLval">Cil.visitCilLval</A> - visit an lvalue
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilInstr">Cil.visitCilInstr</A> - visit an instruction
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilStmt">Cil.visitCilStmt</A> - visit a statement
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilType">Cil.visitCilType</A> - visit a type. Note that this does not visit
the files of a composite type. use visitGlobal to visit the [GCompTag] that
defines the fields.
</UL>
Some transformations may want to use visitors to insert additional
instructions before statements and instructions. To do so, pass a list of
instructions to the <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALqueueInstr">Cil.queueInstr</A> method of the specialized
object. The instructions will automatically be inserted before that
instruction in the transformed code. The <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALunqueueInstr">Cil.unqueueInstr</A> method
should not normally be called by the user. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Interpreted Constructors and Deconstructors-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc10">6.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpreted Constructors and Deconstructors</H3><!--SEC END -->

Interpreted constructors and deconstructors are a facility for constructing
and deconstructing CIL constructs using a pattern with holes that can be
filled with a variety of kinds of elements. The pattern is a string that uses
the C syntax to represent C language elements. For example, the following
code:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
Formatcil.cType "void * const (*)(int x)"
</FONT></PRE>
is an alternative way to construct the internal representation of the type of pointer to function
with an integer argument and a void * const as result: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
TPtr(TFun(TVoid [Attr("const", [])],
          [ ("x", TInt(IInt, []), []) ], false, []), [])
</FONT></PRE>
The advantage of the interpreted constructors is that you can use familiar C
syntax to construct CIL abstract-syntax trees. <BR>
<BR>
You can construct this way types, lvalues, expressions, instructions and
statements. The pattern string can also contain a number of placeholders that
are replaced during construction with CIL items passed as additional argument
to the construction function. For example, the <TT>%e:id</TT> placeholder means
that the argument labeled &#8220;id&#8221; (expected to be of form <TT>Fe exp</TT>) will
supply the expression to replace the placeholder. For example, the following
code constructs an increment instruction at location <TT>loc</TT>:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
Formatcil.cInstr "%v:x = %v:x + %e:something"
        loc
        [ ("something", Fe some_exp);
          ("x", Fv some_varinfo) ]
</FONT></PRE>
An alternative way to construct the same CIL instruction is:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
Set((Var some_varinfo, NoOffset),
    BinOp(PlusA, Lval (Var some_varinfo, NoOffset),
          some_exp, intType), 
    loc)
</FONT></PRE>
See <A HREF="api/Cil.html#TYPEformatArg">Cil.formatArg</A> for a definition of the placeholders that are
understood.<BR>
<BR>
A dual feature is the interpreted deconstructors. This can be used to test
whether a CIL construct has a certain form:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
Formatcil.dType "void * const (*)(int x)" t
</FONT></PRE>
will test whether the actual argument <TT>t</TT> is indeed a function pointer of
the required type. If it is then the result is <TT>Some []</TT> otherwise it is
<TT>None</TT>. Furthermore, for the purpose of the interpreted deconstructors
placeholders in patterns match anything of the right type. For example, 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
Formatcil.dType "void * (*)(%F:t)" t
</FONT></PRE>
will match any function pointer type, independent of the type and number of
the formals. If the match succeeds the result is <TT>Some [ FF forms ]</TT> where
<TT>forms</TT> is a list of names and types of the formals. Note that each member
in the resulting list corresponds positionally to a placeholder in the
pattern.<BR>
<BR>
The interpreted constructors and deconstructors do not support the complete C
syntax, but only a substantial fragment chosen to simplify the parsing. The
following is the syntax that is supported:

Below is an example using interpreted constructors. This example generates
the CIL representation of code that scans an array backwards and initializes
every even-index element with an expression:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
Formatcil.cStmts
  loc
  "int idx = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]) - 1;
   while(idx &gt;= 0) {
     // Some statements to be run for all the elements of the array
     %S:init
     if(! (idx &amp; 1)) 
       array[idx] = %e:init_even;
     /* Do not forget to decrement the index variable */
     idx = idx - 1;
   }"
  (fun n t -&gt; makeTempVar myfunc ~name:n t)
  [ ("array", Fv myarray); 
    ("init", FS [stmt1; stmt2; stmt3]);
    ("init_even", Fe init_expr_for_even_elements) ]
</FONT></PRE>
To write the same CIL statement directly in CIL would take much more effort.
Note that the pattern is parsed only once and the result (a function that
takes the arguments and constructs the statement) is memoized. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection Performance considerations for interpreted constructors-->

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><A NAME="htoc11">6.2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance considerations for interpreted constructors</H4><!--SEC END -->

Parsing the patterns is done with a LALR parser and it takes some time. To
improve performance the constructors and deconstructors memoize the parsed
patterns and will only compile a pattern once. Also all construction and
deconstruction functions can be applied partially to the pattern string to
produce a function that can be later used directly to construct or
deconstruct. This function appears to be about two times slower than if the
construction is done using the CIL constructors (without memoization the
process would be one order of magnitude slower.) However, the convenience of
interpreted constructor might make them a viable choice in many situations
when performance is not paramount (e.g. prototyping).<BR>

The Modules <A HREF="api/Pretty.html">Pretty</A> and <A HREF="api/Errormsg.html">Errormsg</A> contain respectively
utilities for pretty printing and reporting errors and provide a convenient
<TT>printf</TT>-like interface. <BR>
<BR>
Additionally, CIL defines for each major type a pretty-printing function that
you can use in conjunction with the <A HREF="api/Pretty.html">Pretty</A> interface. The
following are some of the pretty-printing functions:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">

CIL has certain internal consistency invariants. For example, all references
to a global variable must point to the same <TT>varinfo</TT> structure. This
ensures that one can rename the variable by changing the name in the
<TT>varinfo</TT>. These constraints are mentioned in the API documentation. There
is also a consistency checker in file <TT>src/check.ml</TT>. If you suspect that
your transformation is breaking these constraints then you can pass the
<TT>--check</TT> option to cilly and this will ensure that the consistency checker
is run after each transformation. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Attributes-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc13">6.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Attributes</H3><!--SEC END -->
<A NAME="sec-attrib"></A>
In CIL you can attach attributes to types and to names (variables, functions
and fields). Attributes are represented using the type <A HREF="api/Cil.html#TYPEattribute">Cil.attribute</A>.
An attribute consists of a name and a number of arguments (represented using
the type <A HREF="api/Cil.html#TYPEattrparam">Cil.attrparam</A>). Almost any expression can be used as an
attribute argument. Attributes are stored in lists sorted by the name of the
attribute. To maintain list ordering, use the functions
<A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALtypeAttrs">Cil.typeAttrs</A> to retrieve the attributes of a type and the functions
<A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALaddAttribute">Cil.addAttribute</A> and <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALaddAttributes">Cil.addAttributes</A> to add attributes.
Alternatively you can use <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALtypeAddAttributes">Cil.typeAddAttributes</A> to add an attribute to
a type (and return the new type).<BR>
<BR>
GCC already has extensive support for attributes, and CIL extends this
support to user-defined attributes. A GCC attribute has the syntax:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
 gccattribute ::= __attribute__((attribute))    (Note the double parentheses)
</PRE>
 Since GCC and MSVC both support various flavors of each attribute (with or
without leading or trailing _) we first strip ALL leading and trailing _
from the attribute name (but not the identified in [ACons] parameters in
<A HREF="api/Cil.html#TYPEattrparam">Cil.attrparam</A>). When we print attributes, for GCC we add two leading
and two trailing _; for MSVC we add just two leading _.<BR>
<BR>
There is support in CIL so that you can control the printing of attributes
(see <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALsetCustomPrintAttribute">Cil.setCustomPrintAttribute</A> and
<A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALsetCustomPrintAttributeScope">Cil.setCustomPrintAttributeScope</A>). This custom-printing support is now
used to print the "const" qualifier as "<TT>const</TT>" and not as
"<TT>__attribute__((const))</TT>".<BR>
<BR>
The attributes are specified in declarations. This is unfortunate since the C
syntax for declarations is already quite complicated and after writing the
parser and elaborator for declarations I am convinced that few C programmers
understand it completely. Anyway, this seems to be the easiest way to support
attributes. <BR>
<BR>
Name attributes must be specified at the very end of the declaration, just
before the <TT>=</TT> for the initializer or before the <TT>,</TT> the separates a
declaration in a group of declarations or just before the <TT>;</TT> that
terminates the declaration. A name attribute for a function being defined can
be specified just before the brace that starts the function body.<BR>
<BR>
For example (in the following examples <TT>A1</TT>,...,<TT>An</TT> are type attributes
and <TT>N</TT> is a name attribute (each of these uses the <TT>__attribute__</TT> syntax):
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
 int x N;
 int x N, * y N = 0, z[] N;
 extern void exit() N;
 int fact(int x) N { ... }
</FONT></PRE>
Type attributes can be specified along with the type using the following
 rules: 
<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
 The type attributes for a base type (int, float, named type, reference
 to struct or union or enum) must be specified immediately following the
 type (actually it is Ok to mix attributes with the specification of the
 type, in between unsigned and int for example).<BR>
<BR>
For example:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
  int A1 x N;  /* A1 applies to the type int. An example is an attribute
                   "even" restricting the type int to even values. */
  struct foo A1 A2 x; // Both A1 and A2 apply to the struct foo type
</FONT></PRE><BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">The type attributes for a pointer type must be specified immediately
 after the * symbol.
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
 /* A pointer (A1) to an int (A2) */
 int A2 * A1 x;
 /* A pointer (A1) to a pointer (A2) to a float (A3) */
 float A3 * A2 * A1 x;
</FONT></PRE>
Note: The attributes for base types and for pointer types are a strict
 extension of the ANSI C type qualifiers (const, volatile and restrict). In
 fact CIL treats these qualifiers as attributes. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">The attributes for a function type or for an array type can be
 specified using parenthesized declarators.<BR>
<BR>
For example:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
   /* A function (A1) from int (A2) to float (A3) */
   float A3 (A1 f)(int A2);

   /* A pointer (A1) to a function (A2) that returns an int (A3) */
   int A3 (A2 * A1 pfun)(void);

   /* An array (A1) of int (A2) */
   int A2 (A1 x0)[]

   /* Array (A1) of pointers (A2) to functions (A3) that take an int (A4) and 
    * return a pointer (A5) to int (A6)  */
   int A6 * A5 (A3 * A2 (A1 x1)[5])(int A4);


   /* A function (A4) that takes a float (A5) and returns a pointer (A6) to an 
    * int (A7) */
   extern int A7 * A6 (A4 x2)(float A5 x);

   /* A function (A1) that takes a int (A2) and that returns a pointer (A3) to 
    * a function (A4) that takes a float (A5) and returns a pointer (A6) to an 
    * int (A7) */
   int A7 * A6 (A4 * A3 (A1 x3)(int A2 x))(float A5) {
      return &amp; x2;
   }
</FONT></PRE></OL>
Note: ANSI C does not allow the specification of type qualifiers for function
and array types, although it allows for the parenthesized declarator. With
just a bit of thought (looking at the first few examples above) I hope that
the placement of attributes for function and array types will seem intuitive.<BR>
<BR>
This extension is not without problems however. If you want to refer just to
a type (in a cast for example) then you leave the name out. But this leads to
strange conflicts due to the parentheses that we introduce to scope the
attributes. Take for example the type of x0 from above. It should be written
as: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
        int A2 (A1 )[]
</FONT></PRE>
But this will lead most C parsers into deep confusion because the parentheses
around A1 will be confused for parentheses of a function designator. To push
this problem around (I don't know a solution) whenever we are about to print a
parenthesized declarator with no name but with attributes, we comment out the
attributes so you can see them (for whatever is worth) without confusing the
compiler. For example, here is how we would print the above type:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
        int A2 /*(A1 )*/[]
</FONT></PRE>
<!--TOC paragraph Handling of predefined GCC attributes-->

<H5 CLASS="paragraph">Handling of predefined GCC attributes</H5><!--SEC END -->

GCC already supports attributes in a lot of places in declarations. The only
place where we support attributes and GCC does not is right before the { that
starts a function body. <BR>
<BR>
GCC classifies its attributes in attributes for functions, for variables and
for types, although the latter category is only usable in definition of struct
or union types and is not nearly as powerful as the CIL type attributes. We
have made an effort to reclassify GCC attributes as name and type attributes
(they only apply for function types). Here is what we came up with:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
 GCC name attributes:<BR>
<BR>
section, constructor, destructor, unused, weak, no_instrument_function,
 noreturn, alias, no_check_memory_usage, dllinport, dllexport, exception,
 model<BR>
<BR>
Note: the "noreturn" attribute would be more appropriately qualified as a
 function type attribute. But we classify it as a name attribute to make
 it easier to support a similarly named MSVC attribute. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">GCC function type attributes:<BR>
<BR>
fconst (printed as "const"), format, regparm, stdcall,
 cdecl, longcall<BR>
<BR>
I was not able to completely decipher the position in which these attributes
 must go. So, the CIL elaborator knows these names and applies the following
 rules: 
 <UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
 All of the name attributes that appear in the specifier part (i.e. at
 the beginning) of a declaration are associated with all declared names. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">All of the name attributes that appear at the end of a declarator are
 associated with the particular name being declared.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">More complicated is the handling of the function type attributes, since
 there can be more than one function in a single declaration (a function
 returning a pointer to a function). Lacking any real understanding of how
 GCC handles this, I attach the function type attribute to the "nearest"
 function. This means that if a pointer to a function is "nearby" the
 attribute will be correctly associated with the function. In truth I pray
 that nobody uses declarations as that of x3 above. 
 </UL>
</UL>
<!--TOC paragraph Handling of predefined MSVC attributes-->

<H5 CLASS="paragraph">Handling of predefined MSVC attributes</H5><!--SEC END -->

MSVC has two kinds of attributes, declaration modifiers to be printed before
 the storage specifier using the notation "<TT>__declspec(...)</TT>" and a few
 function type attributes, printed almost as our CIL function type
 attributes. <BR>
<BR>
The following are the name attributes that are printed using
 <TT>__declspec</TT> right before the storage designator of the declaration:
 thread, naked, dllimport, dllexport, noreturn<BR>
<BR>
The following are the function type attributes supported by MSVC: 
 fastcall, cdecl, stdcall<BR>
<BR>
It is not worth going into the obscure details of where MSVC accepts these
 type attributes. The parser thinks it knows these details and it pulls
 these attributes from wherever they might be placed. The important thing
 is that MSVC will accept if we print them according to the rules of the CIL
 attributes ! <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section The CIL Driver-->

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc14">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The CIL Driver</H2><!--SEC END -->
<A NAME="sec-driver"></A>
We have packaged CIL as an application <TT>cilly</TT> that contains certain
example modules, such as <TT>logwrites.ml</TT> (a module
that instruments code to print the addresses of memory locations being
written). Normally, you write another module like that, add command-line
options and an invocation of your module in <TT>src/main.ml</TT>. Once you compile
CIL you will obtain the file <TT>obj/cilly.asm.exe</TT>. <BR>
<BR>
We wrote a driver for this executable that makes it easy to invoke your
analysis on existing C code with very little manual intervention. This driver
is <TT>bin/cilly</TT> and is quite powerful. Note that the <TT>cilly</TT> script
is configured during installation with the path where CIL resides. This means
that you can move it to any place you want. <BR>
<BR>
A simple use of the driver is:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
bin/cilly --save-temps -D HAPPY_MOOD -I myincludes hello.c -o hello
</PRE>
<FONT COLOR=blue>--save-temps</FONT> tells CIL to save the resulting output files in the
current directory. Otherwise, they'll be put in <TT>/tmp</TT> and deleted
automatically. Not that this is the only CIL-specific flag in the
list &ndash; the other flags use <TT>gcc</TT>'s syntax.<BR>
<BR>
This performs the following actions: 
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
preprocessing using the -D and -I arguments with the resulting 
 file left in <TT>hello.i</TT>, 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the invocation of the <TT>cilly.asm</TT> application which parses <TT>hello.i</TT>
 converts it to CIL and the pretty-prints it to <TT>hello.cil.c</TT>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">another round of preprocessing with the result placed in <TT>hello.cil.i</TT>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the true compilation with the result in <TT>hello.cil.o</TT>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">a linking phase with the result in <TT>hello</TT>
</UL>
Note that <TT>cilly</TT> behaves like the <TT>gcc</TT> compiler. This makes it
easy to use it with existing <TT>Makefiles</TT>:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
make CC="bin/cilly" LD="bin/cilly"
</PRE>
 <TT>cilly</TT> can also behave as the Microsoft Visual C compiler, if the first
 argument is <TT>--mode=MSVC</TT>:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
bin/cilly --mode=MSVC /D HAPPY_MOOD /I myincludes hello.c /Fe hello.exe
</PRE>
 (This in turn will pass a <TT>--MSVC</TT> flag to the underlying <TT>cilly.asm</TT>
 process which will make it understand the Microsoft Visual C extensions)<BR>
<BR>
<TT>cilly</TT> can also behave as the archiver <TT>ar</TT>, if it is passed an
argument <TT>--mode=AR</TT>. Note that only the <TT>cr</TT> mode is supported (create a
new archive and replace all files in there). Therefore the previous version of
the archive is lost. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, <TT>cilly</TT> allows you to pass some arguments on to the
underlying <TT>cilly.asm</TT> process. As a general rule all arguments that start
with <TT>--</TT> and that <TT>cilly</TT> itself does not process, are passed on. For
example, 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
bin/cilly --dologwrites -D HAPPY_MOOD -I myincludes hello.c -o hello.exe
</PRE>
 will produce a file <TT>hello.cil.c</TT> that prints all the memory addresses
written by the application. <BR>
<BR>
The most powerful feature of <TT>cilly</TT> is that it can collect all the
sources in your project, merge them into one file and then apply CIL. This
makes it a breeze to do whole-program analysis and transformation. All you
have to do is to pass the <TT>--merge</TT> flag to <TT>cilly</TT>:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
make CC="bin/cilly --save-temps --dologwrites --merge"
</PRE>
 You can even leave some files untouched:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
make CC="bin/cilly --save-temps --dologwrites --merge --leavealone=foo --leavealone=bar"
</PRE>
 This will merge all the files except those with the basename <TT>foo</TT> and
<TT>bar</TT>. Those files will be compiled as usual and then linked in at the very
end. <BR>
<BR>
The sequence of actions performed by <TT>cilly</TT> depends on whether merging
is turned on or not:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
If merging is off
 <OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">

<BR>
<BR>
We are developing a suite of modules that use CIL for program analyses and
transformations that we have found useful. You can use these modules directly
on your code, or generally as inspiration for writing similar modules. A
particularly big and complex application written on top of CIL is CCured
(<A HREF="../ccured/index.html"><TT>../ccured/index.html</TT></A>).<BR>

<!--TOC subsection Control-Flow Graphs-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc18">8.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Control-Flow Graphs</H3><!--SEC END -->
 <A NAME="sec-cfg"></A>
The <A HREF="api/Cil.html#TYPEstmt">Cil.stmt</A> datatype includes fields for intraprocedural
control-flow information: the predecessor and successor statements of
the current statement. This information is not computed by default.
If you want to use the control-flow graph, or any of the extensions in
this section that require it, you have to explicitly ask CIL to
compute the CFG.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection The CFG module (new in CIL 1.3.5)-->

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><A NAME="htoc19">8.1.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFG module (new in CIL 1.3.5)</H4><!--SEC END -->

The best way to compute the CFG is with the CFG module. Just invoke
<A HREF="api/Cfg.html#VALcomputeFileCFG">Cfg.computeFileCFG</A> on your file. The <A HREF="api/Cfg.html">Cfg</A> API
describes the rest of actions you can take with this module, including
computing the CFG for one function at a time, or printing the CFG in
<TT>dot</TT> form.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection Simplified control flow-->

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><A NAME="htoc20">8.1.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplified control flow</H4><!--SEC END -->

CIL can reduce high-level C control-flow constructs like <TT>switch</TT> and
<TT>continue</TT> to lower-level <TT>goto</TT>s. This completely eliminates some
possible classes of statements from the program and may make the result
easier to analyze (e.g., it simplifies data-flow analysis).<BR>
<BR>
You can invoke this transformation on the command line with
<TT>--domakeCFG</TT> or programatically with <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALprepareCFG">Cil.prepareCFG</A>.
After calling Cil.prepareCFG, you can use <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALcomputeCFGInfo">Cil.computeCFGInfo</A>
to compute the CFG information and find the successor and predecessor
of each statement.<BR>
<BR>
For a concrete example, you can see how <TT>cilly --domakeCFG</TT>
transforms the following code (note the fall-through in case 1): 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
  int foo (int predicate) {
    int x = 0;
    switch (predicate) {
      case 0: return 111;
      case 1: x = x + 1;
      case 2: return (x+3);
      case 3: break;
      default: return 222;

<!--TOC subsection Points-to Analysis-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc23">8.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Points-to Analysis</H3><!--SEC END -->

The module <TT>ptranal.ml</TT> contains two interprocedural points-to
analyses for CIL: <TT>Olf</TT> and <TT>Golf</TT>. <TT>Olf</TT> is the default.
(Switching from <TT>olf.ml</TT> to <TT>golf.ml</TT> requires a change in
<TT>Ptranal</TT> and a recompiling <TT>cilly</TT>.)<BR>
<BR>
The analyses have the following characteristics:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Not based on C types (inferred pointer relationships are sound
 despite most kinds of C casts)
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">One level of subtyping 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">One level of context sensitivity (Golf only)
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Monomorphic type structures
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Field insensitive (fields of structs are conflated)
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Demand-driven (points-to queries are solved on demand)
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Handle function pointers
</UL>
The analysis itself is factored into two components: <TT>Ptranal</TT>,
which walks over the CIL file and generates constraints, and <TT>Olf</TT>
or <TT>Golf</TT>, which solve the constraints. The analysis is invoked
with the function <TT>Ptranal.analyze_file: Cil.file -&gt;
 unit</TT>. This function builds the points-to graph for the CIL file
and stores it internally. There is currently no facility for clearing
internal state, so <TT>Ptranal.analyze_file</TT> should only be called
once.<BR>
<BR>
The constructed points-to graph supports several kinds of queries,
including alias queries (may two expressions be aliased?) and
points-to queries (to what set of locations may an expression point?).<BR>
<BR>
The main interface with the alias analysis is as follows:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>Ptranal.may_alias: Cil.exp -&gt; Cil.exp -&gt; bool</TT>. If
 <TT>true</TT>, the two expressions may have the same value.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.resolve_lval: Cil.lval -&gt; (Cil.varinfo
 list)</TT>. Returns the list of variables to which the given
 left-hand value may point.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.resolve_exp: Cil.exp -&gt; (Cil.varinfo list)</TT>.
 Returns the list of variables to which the given expression may
 point.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.resolve_funptr: Cil.exp -&gt; (Cil.fundec
 list)</TT>. Returns the list of functions to which the given
 expression may point.
</UL>
The precision of the analysis can be customized by changing the values
of several flags:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>Ptranal.no_sub: bool ref</TT>.
 If <TT>true</TT>, subtyping is disabled. Associated commandline option:
 <B>--ptr_unify</B>.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.analyze_mono: bool ref</TT>.
 (Golf only) If <TT>true</TT>, context sensitivity is disabled and the
 analysis is effectively monomorphic. Commandline option:
 <B>--ptr_mono</B>.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.smart_aliases: bool ref</TT>.
 (Golf only) If <TT>true</TT>, &#8220;smart&#8221; disambiguation of aliases is
 enabled. Otherwise, aliases are computed by intersecting points-to
 sets. This is an experimental feature.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.model_strings: bool ref</TT>.
 Make the alias analysis model string constants by treating them as
 pointers to chars. Commandline option: <B>--ptr_model_strings</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.conservative_undefineds: bool ref</TT>.
 Make the most pessimistic assumptions about globals if an undefined
 function is present. Such a function can write to every global
 variable. Commandline option: <B>--ptr_conservative</B>
</UL>
In practice, the best precision/efficiency tradeoff is achieved by
setting <TT>Ptranal.no_sub</TT> to <TT>false</TT>, <TT>Ptranal.analyze_mono</TT> to
<TT>true</TT>, and <TT>Ptranal.smart_aliases</TT> to <TT>false</TT>. These are the
default values of the flags.<BR>
<BR>
There are also a few flags that can be used to inspect or serialize
the results of the analysis.
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>Ptranal.debug_may_aliases</TT>.
 Print the may-alias relationship of each pair of expressions in the
 program. Commandline option: <B>--ptr_may_aliases</B>.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.print_constraints: bool ref</TT>.
 If <TT>true</TT>, the analysis will print each constraint as it is
 generated.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.print_types: bool ref</TT>.
 If <TT>true</TT>, the analysis will print the inferred type of each
 variable in the program.<BR>
<BR>
If <TT>Ptranal.analyze_mono</TT> and <TT>Ptranal.no_sub</TT> are both
 <TT>true</TT>, this output is sufficient to reconstruct the points-to
 graph. One nice feature is that there is a pretty printer for
 recursive types, so the print routine does not loop.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>Ptranal.compute_results: bool ref</TT>.
 If <TT>true</TT>, the analysis will print out the points-to set of each
 variable in the program. This will essentially serialize the
 points-to graph.
</UL>
<!--TOC subsection StackGuard-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc24">8.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;StackGuard</H3><!--SEC END -->

The module <TT>heapify.ml</TT> contains a transformation similar to the one
described in &#8220;StackGuard: Automatic Adaptive Detection and Prevention of
Buffer-Overflow Attacks&#8221;, <EM>Proceedings of the 7th USENIX Security
Conference</EM>. In essence it modifies the program to maintain a separate
stack for return addresses. Even if a buffer overrun attack occurs the
actual correct return address will be taken from the special stack. <BR>
<BR>
Although it does work, this CIL module is provided mainly as an example of
how to perform a simple source-to-source program analysis and
transformation. As an optimization only functions that contain a dangerous
local array make use of the special return address stack. <BR>
<BR>
For a concrete example, you can see how <TT>cilly --dostackGuard</TT>
transforms the following dangerous code: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
  int dangerous() {
    char array[10];
    scanf("%s",array); // possible buffer overrun!

The module <TT>heapify.ml</TT> also contains a transformation that moves all
dangerous local arrays to the heap. This also prevents a number of buffer
overruns. <BR>
<BR>
For a concrete example, you can see how <TT>cilly --doheapify</TT>
transforms the following dangerous code: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>

The module <TT>oneret.ml</TT> contains a transformation the ensures that all
function bodies have at most one return statement. This simplifies a number
of analyses by providing a canonical exit-point. <BR>
<BR>
For a concrete example, you can see how <TT>cilly --dooneRet</TT>
transforms the following code: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
  int foo (int predicate) {
    if (predicate &lt;= 0) {
      return 1;

The <TT>partial.ml</TT> module provides a simple interprocedural partial

<!--TOC subsection Reaching Definitions-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc28">8.9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaching Definitions</H3><!--SEC END -->

The <TT>reachingdefs.ml</TT> module uses the dataflow framework and CFG
information to calculate the definitions that reach each
statement. After computing the CFG (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-cfg">8.1</A>) and calling
<TT>computeRDs</TT> on a 
function declaration, <TT>ReachingDef.stmtStartData</TT> will contain a
mapping from statement IDs to data about which definitions reach each
statement. In particular, it is a mapping from statement IDs to a
triple the first two members of which are used internally. The third
member is a mapping from variable IDs to Sets of integer options. If
the set contains <TT>Some(i)</TT>, then the definition of that variable
with ID <TT>i</TT> reaches that statement. If the set contains <TT>None</TT>,
then there is a path to that statement on which there is no definition
of that variable. Also, if the variable ID is unmapped at a
statement, then no definition of that variable reaches that statement.<BR>
<BR>
To summarize, reachingdefs.ml has the following interface:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>computeRDs</TT> &ndash; Computes reaching definitions. Requires that
CFG information has already been computed for each statement.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>ReachingDef.stmtStartData</TT> &ndash; contains reaching

<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>ReachingDef.defIdStmtHash</TT> &ndash; Contains a mapping
from definition IDs to the ID of the statement in which
the definition occurs.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>getRDs</TT> &ndash; Takes a statement ID and returns
reaching definition data for that statement.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>instrRDs</TT> &ndash; Takes a list of instructions and the
definitions that reach the first instruction, and for
each instruction calculates the definitions that reach
either into or out of that instruction.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>rdVisitorClass</TT> &ndash; A subclass of nopCilVisitor that
can be extended such that the current reaching definition
data is available when expressions are visited through
the <TT>get_cur_iosh</TT> method of the class.

<!--TOC subsection Available Expressions-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc29">8.10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Available Expressions</H3><!--SEC END -->

The <TT>availexps.ml</TT> module uses the dataflow framework and CFG
information to calculate something similar to a traditional available
expressions analysis. After <TT>computeAEs</TT> is called following a CFG
calculation (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-cfg">8.1</A>), <TT>AvailableExps.stmtStartData</TT> will
contain a mapping
from statement IDs to data about what expressions are available at
that statement. The data for each statement is a mapping for each
variable ID to the whole expression available at that point(in the
traditional sense) which the variable was last defined to be. So,
this differs from a traditional available expressions analysis in that
only whole expressions from a variable definition are considered rather
than all expressions.<BR>
<BR>

CIL operates after preprocessing. If you need to see comments, for
example, you cannot use CIL. But you can use attributes and pragmas instead.

<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
  mytype x = __builtin_va_arg(marker, mytype)
</PRE>into 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
 mytype x;
 __builtin_va_arg(marker, sizeof(mytype), &amp;x);

definition is considered a prototype (its body is ignored). If optimizations
are turned on then the extern inline function is inlined at all of its
occurrences from the point of its definition all the way to the point where the

inline function. A body is generated for the real definition and that one is

CIL will rename your extern inline function (and its uses) with the suffix

<!--TOC section Using the merger-->

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc39">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the merger</H2><!--SEC END -->
<A NAME="sec-merger"></A><!--NAME merger.html-->
<BR>
<BR>
There are many program analyses that are more effective when
done on the whole program.<BR>
<BR>
The merger is a tool that combines all of the C source files in a project
into a single C file. There are two tasks that a merger must perform:
<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
Detect what are all the sources that make a project and with what
compiler arguments they are compiled.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Merge all of the source files into a single file. 
</OL>
For the first task the merger impersonates a compiler and a linker (both a
GCC and a Microsoft Visual C mode are supported) and it expects to be invoked
(from a build script or a Makefile) on all sources of the project. When
invoked to compile a source the merger just preprocesses the source and saves
the result using the name of the requested object file. By preprocessing at
this time the merger is able to take into account variations in the command
line arguments that affect preprocessing of different source files.<BR>
<BR>
When the merger is invoked to link a number of object files it collects the
preprocessed sources that were stored with the names of the object files, and
invokes the merger proper. Note that arguments that affect the compilation or
linking must be the same for all source files.<BR>
<BR>
For the second task, the merger essentially concatenates the preprocessed
sources with care to rename conflicting file-local declarations (we call this
process alpha-conversion of a file). The merger also attempts to remove
duplicate global declarations and definitions. Specifically the following
actions are taken: 
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
File-scope names (<TT>static</TT> globals, names of types defined with
<TT>typedef</TT>, and structure/union/enumeration tags) are given new names if they
conflict with declarations from previously processed sources. The new name is
formed by appending the suffix <TT>___n</TT>, where <TT>n</TT> is a unique integer
identifier. Then the new names are applied to their occurrences in the file. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Non-static declarations and definitions of globals are never renamed.
But we try to remove duplicate ones. Equality of globals is detected by
comparing the printed form of the global (ignoring the line number directives)
after the body has been alpha-converted. This process is intended to remove
those declarations (e.g. function prototypes) that originate from the same
include file. Similarly, we try to eliminate duplicate definitions of
<TT>inline</TT> functions, since these occasionally appear in include files.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">The types of all global declarations with the same name from all files
are compared for type isomorphism. During this process, the merger detects all
those isomorphisms between structures and type definitions that are <B>required</B> for the merged program to be legal. Such structure tags and
typenames are coalesced and given the same name. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">Besides the structure tags and type names that are required to be
isomorphic, the merger also tries to coalesce definitions of structures and
types with the same name from different file. However, in this case the merger
will not give an error if such definitions are not isomorphic; it will just
use different names for them. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">In rare situations, it can happen that a file-local global in
encountered first and it is not renamed, only to discover later when
processing another file that there is an external symbol with the same name.
In this case, a second pass is made over the merged file to rename the
file-local symbol. 
</UL>
Here is an example of using the merger:<BR>
<BR>
The contents of <TT>file1.c</TT> is:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
struct foo; // Forward declaration
extern struct foo *global;
</FONT></PRE>
The contents of <TT>file2.c</TT> is:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
struct bar {
 int x;
 struct bar *next;
};
extern struct bar *global;
struct foo {
 int y;
};
extern struct foo another;
void main() {
}
</FONT></PRE>
There are several ways in which one might create an executable from these
files:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
gcc file1.c file2.c -o a.out
</PRE><BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><PRE CLASS="verbatim">
gcc -c file1.c -o file1.o
gcc -c file2.c -o file2.o
ld file1.o file2.o -o a.out
</PRE><BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><PRE CLASS="verbatim">
gcc -c file1.c -o file1.o
gcc -c file2.c -o file2.o
ar r libfile2.a file2.o
gcc file1.o libfile2.a -o a.out
</PRE><BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><PRE CLASS="verbatim">
gcc -c file1.c -o file1.o
gcc -c file2.c -o file2.o
ar r libfile2.a file2.o
gcc file1.o -lfile2 -o a.out
</PRE></UL>
In each of the cases above you must replace all occurrences of <TT>gcc</TT> and
<TT>ld</TT> with <TT>cilly --merge</TT>, and all occurrences of <TT>ar</TT> with <TT>cilly
--merge --mode=AR</TT>. It is very important that the <TT>--merge</TT> flag be used
throughout the build process. If you want to see the merged source file you
must also pass the <TT>--keepmerged</TT> flag to the linking phase. <BR>
<BR>
The result of merging file1.c and file2.c is:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim"><FONT COLOR=blue>
// from file1.c
struct foo; // Forward declaration
extern struct foo *global;

// from file2.c
struct foo {
 int x;
 struct foo *next;
};

 int y;
};
extern struct foo___1 another;

Occasionally we have needed to modify slightly the standard include files.
So, we developed a simple mechanism that allows us to create modified copies
of the include files and use them instead of the standard ones. For this
purpose we specify a patch file and we run a program caller Patcher which
makes modified copies of include files and applies the patch.<BR>
<BR>
The patcher is invoked as follows: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
bin/patcher [options]

Options:
  --help       Prints this help message
  --verbose    Prints a lot of information about what is being done
  --mode=xxx   What tool to emulate: 
                GNUCC     - GNU CC
                MSVC      - MS VC cl compiler

  --dest=xxx   The destination directory. Will make one if it does not exist
  --patch=xxx  Patch file (can be specified multiple times)
  --ppargs=xxx An argument to be passed to the preprocessor (can be specified
               multiple times)

  --ufile=xxx  A user-include file to be patched (treated as \#include "xxx")
  --sfile=xxx  A system-include file to be patched (treated as \#include &lt;xxx&gt;)
 
  --clean       Remove all files in the destination directory
  --dumpversion Print the version name used for the current compiler

 All of the other arguments are passed to the preprocessor. You should pass
 enough arguments (e.g., include directories) so that the patcher can find the
 right include files to be patched.
</PRE>
 Based on the given <TT>mode</TT> and the current version of the compiler (which
the patcher can print when given the <TT>dumpversion</TT> argument) the patcher
will create a subdirectory of the <TT>dest</TT> directory (say <TT>/usr/home/necula/cil/include</TT>), such as:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
/usr/home/necula/cil/include/gcc_2.95.3-5
</PRE>
 In that file the patcher will copy the modified versions of the include files
specified with the <TT>ufile</TT> and <TT>sfile</TT> options. Each of these options can
be specified multiple times. <BR>
<BR>
The patch file (specified with the <TT>patch</TT> option) has a format inspired by
the Unix <TT>patch</TT> tool. The file has the following grammar:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
&lt;&lt;&lt; flags
patterns
===
replacement
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</PRE>
 The flags are a comma separated, case-sensitive, sequence of keywords or
keyword = value. The following flags are supported:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>file=foo.h</TT> - will only apply the patch on files whose name is
 <TT>foo.h</TT>. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>optional</TT> - this means that it is Ok if the current patch does not
match any of the processed files. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>group=foo</TT> - will add this patch to the named group. If this is not

Most of the time we debug our code using the Errormsg module along with the
pretty printer. But if you want to use the Ocaml debugger here is an easy way
to do it. Say that you want to debug the invocation of cilly that arises out
of the following command:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
cilly -c hello.c 
</PRE>
 You must follow the installation <A HREF="../ccured/setup.html">instructions</A>
to install the Elist support files for ocaml and to extend your .emacs
appropriately. Then from within Emacs you do
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
ALT-X my-camldebug
</PRE>
 This will ask you for the command to use for running the Ocaml debugger
(initially the default will be &#8220;ocamldebug&#8221; or the last command you
introduced). You use the following command:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">
cilly --ocamldebug -c hello.c 
</PRE>
 This will run <TT>cilly</TT> as usual and invoke the Ocaml debugger when the cilly
engine starts. The advantage of this way of invoking the debugger is that the
directory search paths are set automatically and the right set or arguments is
passed to the debugger. <BR>

When I (George) started to write CIL I thought it was going to take two weeks.
Exactly a year has passed since then and I am still fixing bugs in it. This
gross underestimate was due to the fact that I thought parsing and making
sense of C is simple. You probably think the same. What I did not expect was
how many dark corners this language has, especially if you want to parse
real-world programs such as those written for GCC or if you are more ambitious
and you want to parse the Linux or Windows NT sources (both of these were
written without any respect for the standard and with the expectation that
compilers will be changed to accommodate the program). <BR>
<BR>
The following examples were actually encountered either in real programs or
are taken from the ISO C99 standard or from the GCC's testcases. My first
reaction when I saw these was: <EM>Is this C?</EM>. The second one was : <EM>What the hell does it mean?</EM>. <BR>
<BR>
If you are contemplating doing program analysis for C on abstract-syntax
trees then your analysis ought to be able to handle these things. Or, you can
use CIL and let CIL translate them into clean C code. <BR>

<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>March 30, 2006</B>: Fix for <TT>rmtemps.ml</TT>, which deletes
 unused inline functions. When in <TT>gcc</TT> mode CIL now leaves all
 inline functions in place, since <TT>gcc</TT> treats these as externally

<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 30, 2005</B>: Added support for many GCC <TT>__builtin</TT>
 functions. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 30, 2005</B>: Added the EXTRAFEATURES configure
 option, making it easier to add Features to the build process.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 23, 2005</B>: In MSVC mode do not remove any locals whose name
 appears as a substring in an inline assembly. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 23, 2005</B>: Do not add a return to functions that have the

 to Nick Petroni and Remco van Engelen for the patches.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 26, 2005</B>: CIL no longer uses the `<TT>-I-</TT>' flag
 by default when preprocessing with gcc.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 24, 2005</B>: Added a command-line option
 &#8220;--forceRLArgEval&#8221; that forces function arguments to be evaluated
 right-to-left. This is the default behavior in unoptimized gcc and
 MSVC, but the order of evaluation is undefined when using
 optimizations, unless you apply this CIL transformation. This flag
 does not affect the order of evaluation of e.g. binary operators,
 which remains undefined. Thanks to Nathan Cooprider for the patch.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 9, 2005</B>: Fixed merging when there are more than 20
 input files.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 3, 2005</B>: When merging, it is now an error to
 declare the same global variable twice with different initializers.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 27, 2005</B>: Fixed bug in transparent unions.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 27, 2005</B>: Fixed bug in collectInitializer. Thanks to

<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 26, 2005</B>: Better support for extended inline assembly
 in gcc.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 26, 2005</B>: Added many more gcc __builtin* functions
 to CIL. Most are treated as Call instructions, but a few are
 translated into expressions so that they can be used in global
 initializers. For example, &#8220;<TT>__builtin_offsetof(t, field)</TT>&#8221; is
 rewritten as &#8220;<TT>&amp;((t*)0)-&gt;field</TT>&#8221;, the traditional way of calculating
 an offset.

<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 31, 2005</B>: Fixed handling of noreturn attribute for function
 pointers. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 30, 2005</B>: Fixed bugs in the handling of constructors in gcc.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 30, 2005</B>: Fixed bugs in the generation of global variable IDs.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Reimplemented the translation of function calls so
 that we can intercept some builtins. This is important for the uses of
 __builtin_constant_p in constants. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Export the plainCilPrinter, for debugging.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Fixed bug with printing of const attribute for
 arrays. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Fixed bug in generation of type signatures. Now they
 should not contain expressions anymore, so you can use structural equality.
 This used to lead to Out_of_Memory exceptions.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Fixed bug in type comparisons using
 TBuiltin_va_list.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Improved the constant folding in array lengths and
 case expressions. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Added the <TT>__builtin_frame_address</TT> to the set
 of gcc builtins.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 27, 2005</B>: Added the CIL project to SourceForge.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 23, 2005</B>: The cattr field was not visited.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>March 6, 2005</B>: Debian packaging support
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 16, 2005</B>: Merger fixes.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 11, 2005</B>: Fixed a bug in <TT>--dopartial</TT>. Thanks to
Nathan Cooprider for this fix. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 31, 2005</B>: Make sure the input file is closed even if a
 parsing error is encountered. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 11, 2005</B>: <B>Released version 1.3.2</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 11, 2005</B>: Fixed printing of integer constants whose
 integer kind is shorter than an int. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 11, 2005</B>: Added checks for negative size arrays and arrays
 too big. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Added support for GCC attribute &#8220;volatile&#8221; for
 tunctions (as a synonim for noreturn). 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Improved the comparison of array sizes when
 comparing array types. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed handling of shell metacharacters in the
 cilly command lione.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed dropping of cast in initialization of
 local variable with the result of a function call.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed some structural comparisons that were
 broken in the Ocaml 3.08.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed the <TT>unrollType</TT> function to not forget
 attributes. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Better keeping track of locations of function
 prototypes and definitions. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 10, 2005</B>: Fixed bug with the expansion of enumeration
 constants in attributes.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>October 18, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in cabsvisit.ml. CIl would wrap a
 BLOCK around a single atom unnecessarily. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 7, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.3.1</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 4, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in splitting of structs using 
 <TT>--dosimplify</TT>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 29, 2004</B>: Minor changes to the type typeSig (type signatures)
 to ensure that they do not contain types, so that you can do structural
 comparison without danger of nontermination. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 28, 2004</B>: Ocaml version 3.08 is required. Numerous small 
 changes while porting to Ocaml 3.08. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 7, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.6</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 2, 2004</B>: Character constants such as <TT>'c'</TT> should
 have type <TT>int</TT>, not <TT>char</TT>. Added a utility function
 <TT>Cil.charConstToInt</TT> that sign-extends chars greater than 128, if needed.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 2, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug that was casting values to int
 before applying the logical negation operator !. This caused
 problems for floats, and for integer types bigger than <TT>int</TT>.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 13, 2004</B>: Added the field <TT>sallstmts</TT> to a function
 description, to hold all statements in the function.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 13, 2004</B>: Added new extensions for data flow analyses, and
 for computing dominators.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 10, 2004</B>: Force initialization of CIL at the start of
Cabs2cil. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 9, 2004</B>: Added support for GCC <TT>__attribute_used__</TT>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 7, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.5</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Allow now to run ./configure CC=cl and set the MSVC
compiler to be the default. The MSVC driver will now select the default name
of the .exe file like the CL compiler. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in the driver. The temporary files are
deleted by the Perl script before the CL compiler gets to them?
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Added the - form of arguments to the MSVC driver.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Added a few more GCC-specific string escapes, (, [,
{, %, E. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 7, 2004</B>: Fixed bug with continuation lines in MSVC.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 6, 2004</B>: Fixed embarassing bug in the parser: the precedence
 of casts and unary operators was switched. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 5, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug involving statements mixed between
declarations containing initializers. Now we make sure that the initializers
are run in the proper order with respect to the statements.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 5, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in the merger. The merger was keeping
separate alpha renaming talbes (namespaces) for variables and types. This
means that it might end up with a type and a variable named the same way, if
they come from different files, which breaks an important CIL invariant.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>March 11, 2004</B> : Fixed a bug in the Cil.copyFunction function. The
new local variables were not getting fresh IDs. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>March 5, 2004</B>: Fixed a bug in the handling of static function
 prototypes in a block scope. They used to be renamed. Now we just consider
 them global. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 20, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.4</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 15, 2004</B>: Changed the parser to allow extra semicolons
 after field declarations.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 14, 2004</B>: Changed the Errormsg functions: error, unimp,
bug to not raise an exception. Instead they just set Errormsg.hadErrors. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 13, 2004</B>: Change the parsing of attributes to recognize
 enumeration constants.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 10, 2004</B>: In some versions of <TT>gcc</TT> the identifier
 _{thread is an identifier and in others it is a keyword. Added code
 during configuration to detect which is the case. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 7, 2004</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.3</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 7, 2004</B>: Changed the alpha renamer to be less
conservative. It will remember all versions of a name that were seen and will
only create a new name if we have not seen one. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 30, 2003</B> : Extended the <TT>cilly</TT> command to understand
 better linker command options <TT>-lfoo</TT>. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 5, 2003</B>: Added markup commands to the pretty-printer
module. Also, changed the &#8220;@&lt;&#8221; left-flush command into &#8220;@''.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 4, 2003</B>: Wide string literals are now handled
directly by Cil (rather than being exploded into arrays). This is
apparently handy for Microsoft Device Driver APIs that use intrinsic
functions that require literal constant wide-string arguments. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 3, 2003</B>: Added support for structured exception handling
 extensions for the Microsoft compilers.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 1, 2003</B>: Fixed a Makefile bug in the generation of the 
Cil library (e.g., <TT>cil.cma</TT>) that was causing it to be unusable. Thanks
to KEvin Millikin for pointing out this bug. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 26, 2003</B>: Added support for linkage specifications
 (extern &#8220;C&#8221;). 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 26, 2003</B>: Added the ocamlutil directory to contain some
utilities shared with other projects. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 25, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.2.2</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 24, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug that allowed a static local to
 conflict with a global with the same name that is declared later in the
 file. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 24, 2003</B>: Removed the <TT>--keep</TT> option of the <TT>cilly</TT>
 driver and replaced it with <TT>--save-temps</TT>.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 24, 2003</B>: Added printing of what CIL features are being
 run.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 24, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug that resulted in attributes being
 dropped for integer types. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>November 11, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug in the visitor for enumeration
 definitions. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>October 24, 2003</B>: Fixed a problem in the configuration script. It
 was not recognizing the Ocaml version number for beta versions. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>October 15, 2003</B>: Fixed a problem in version 1.2.1 that was
 preventing compilation on OCaml 3.04.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 17, 2003: Released version 1.2.1.</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 7, 2003</B>: Redesigned the interface for choosing
 <TT>#line</TT> directive printing styles. Cil.printLn and
 Cil.printLnComment have been merged into Cil.lineDirectiveStyle.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 8, 2003</B>: Do not silently pad out functions calls with
arguments to match the prototype. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 1, 2003</B>: A variety of fixes suggested by Steve Chamberlain:
initializers for externs, prohibit float literals in enum, initializers for
unsized arrays were not working always, an overflow problem in Ocaml, changed
the processing of attributes before struct specifiers<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 14, 2003</B>: Add basic support for GCC's "__thread" storage
qualifier. If given, it will appear as a "thread" attribute at the top of the
type of the declared object. Treatment is very similar to "__declspec(...)"
in MSVC<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 8, 2003</B>: Fixed some of the __alignof computations. Fixed
 bug in the designated initializers for arrays (Array.get error).
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 8, 2003</B>: Fixed infinite loop bug (Stack Overflow) in the
 visitor for __alignof.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 8, 2003</B>: Fixed bug in the conversion to CIL. A function or
 array argument of
 the GCC __typeof() was being converted to pointer type. Instead, it should
 be left alone, just like for sizeof. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 7, 2003</B>: New Escape module provides utility functions
 for escaping characters and strings in accordance with C lexical
 rules.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>July 2, 2003</B>: Relax CIL's rules for when two enumeration types are
considered compatible. Previously CIL considered two enums to be compatible if
they were the same enum. Now we follow the C99 standard.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 28, 2003</B>: In the Formatparse module, Eric Haugh found and
 fixed a bug in the handling of lvalues of the form &#8220;lv-&gt;field.more&#8221;.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 28, 2003</B>: Extended the handling of gcc command lines
arguments in the Perl scripts. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 23, 2003</B>: In Rmtmps module, simplified the API for
 customizing the root set. Clients may supply a predicate that
 returns true for each root global. Modifying various
 &#8220;<TT>referenced</TT>&#8221; fields directly is no longer supported.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 17, 2003</B>: Reimplement internal utility routine
 <TT>Cil.escape_char</TT>. Faster and better. <BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>June 14, 2003</B>: Implemented support for <TT>__attribute__s</TT>
appearing between "struct" and the struct tag name (also for unions and
enums), since gcc supports this as documented in section 4.30 of the gcc
(2.95.3) manual<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 30, 2003</B>: Released the regression tests. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 28, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.1.2</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 26, 2003</B>: Add the <TT>simplify</TT> module that compiles CIL
expressions into simpler expressions, similar to those that appear in a
3-address intermediate language.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 26, 2003</B>: Various fixes and improvements to the pointer
analysis modules. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 26, 2003</B>: Added optional consistency checking for
transformations.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 25, 2003</B>: Added configuration support for big endian machines.
Now <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALlittle_endian">Cil.little_endian</A> can be used to test whether the machine is
little endian or not. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 22, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug in the handling of inline functions. The
CIL merger used to turn these functions into &#8220;static&#8221;, which is incorrect. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 22, 2003</B>: Expanded the CIL consistency checker to verify
undesired sharing relationships between data structures. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 22, 2003</B>: Fixed bug in the <TT>oneret</TT> CIL module: it was
mishandling certain labeled return statements. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 5, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.11</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 5, 2003</B>: OS X (powerpc/darwin) support for CIL. Special 
thanks to Jeff Foster, Andy Begel and Tim Leek. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 30, 2003</B>: Better description of how to use CIL for your
analysis. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 28, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug with <TT>--dooneRet</TT> and
<TT>--doheapify</TT>. Thanks, Manos Renieris.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 16, 2003</B>: Reworked management of
 temporary/intermediate output files in Perl driver scripts. Default
 behavior is now to remove all such files. To keep intermediate
 files, use one of the following existing flags:
 <UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
 <TT>--keepmerged</TT> for the single-file merge of all sources
 <LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>--keep=&lt;<I>dir</I></TT><TT>&gt;</TT> for various other CIL and
 CCured output files
 <LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>--save-temps</TT> for various gcc intermediate files; MSVC
 has no equivalent option
 </UL>
 As part of this change, some intermediate files have changed their
 names slightly so that new suffixes are always preceded by a
 period. For example, CCured output that used to appear in
 &#8220;<TT>foocured.c</TT>&#8221; now appears in &#8220;<TT>foo.cured.c</TT>&#8221;.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 7, 2003</B>: Changed the representation of the <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALGVar">Cil.GVar</A>
global constructor. Now it is possible to update the initializer without
reconstructing the global (which in turn it would require reconstructing the
list of globals that make up a program). We did this because it is often
tempting to use <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALvisitCilFileSameGlobals">Cil.visitCilFileSameGlobals</A> and the <A HREF="api/Cil.html#VALGVar">Cil.GVar</A>
was the only global that could not be updated in place. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>April 6, 2003</B>: Reimplemented parts of the cilly.pl script to make
it more robust in the presence of complex compiler arguments. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>March 10, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.9</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>March 10, 2003</B>: Unified and documented a large number of CIL
Library Modules: oneret, simplemem, makecfg, heapify, stackguard, partial.
Also documented the main client interface for the pointer analysis. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 18, 2003</B>: Fixed a bug in logwrites that was causing it
to produce invalid C code on writes to bitfields. Thanks, David Park. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 15, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.8</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 15, 2003</B>: PDF versions of the manual and API are
available for those who would like to print them out. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 14, 2003</B>: CIL now comes bundled with alias analyses. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 11, 2003</B>: Added support for adding/removing options from
 <TT>./configure</TT>. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 3, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.7</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>February 1, 2003</B>: Some bug fixes in the handling of variable
argument functions in new versions of <TT>gcc</TT> And <TT>glibc</TT>. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 29, 2003</B>: Added the logical AND and OR operators.
Exapanded the translation to CIL to handle more complicated initializers
(including those that contain logical operators).
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 28, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.6</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 28, 2003</B>: Added support for the new handling of
variable-argument functions in new versions of <TT>glibc</TT>. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 19, 2003</B>: Added support for declarations in interpreted
 constructors. Relaxed the semantics of the patterns for variables. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 17, 2003</B>: Added built-in prototypes for the gcc built-in
 functions. Changed the <TT>pGlobal</TT> method in the printers to print the
 carriage return as well.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 9, 2003</B>: Reworked lexer and parser's strategy for
 tracking source file names and line numbers to more closely match
 typical native compiler behavior. The visible CIL interface is
 unchanged.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 9, 2003</B>: Changed the interface to the alpha convertor. Now
you can pass a list where it will record undo information that you can use to
revert the changes that it makes to the scope tables.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 6, 2003</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.5</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 4, 2003</B>: Changed the interface for the Formatcil module.
 Now the placeholders in the pattern have names. Also expanded the
 documentation of the Formatcil module.
 Now the placeholders in the pattern have names.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>January 3, 2003</B>: Extended the <TT>rmtmps</TT> module to also remove
 unused labels that are generated in the conversion to CIL. This reduces the
 number of warnings that you get from <TT>cgcc</TT> afterwards.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 17, 2002</B>: Fixed a few bugs in CIL related to the
 representation of string literals. The standard says that a string literal
 is an array. In CIL, a string literal has type pointer to character. This is
 Ok, except as an argument of sizeof. To support this exception, we have
 added to CIL the expression constructor SizeOfStr. This allowed us to fix
 bugs with computing <TT>sizeof("foo bar")</TT> and <TT>sizeof((char*)"foo bar")</TT>
 (the former is 8 and the latter is 4).<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 8, 2002</B>: Fixed a few bugs in the lexer and parser
 relating to hex and octal escapes in string literals. Also fixed
 the dependencies between the lexer and parser.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 5, 2002</B>: Fixed visitor bugs that were causing
 some attributes not to be visited and some queued instructions to be
 dropped.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>December 3, 2002</B>: Added a transformation to catch stack
 overflows. Fixed the heapify transformation.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>October 14, 2002</B>: CIL is now available under the BSD license
(see the License section or the file LICENSE). <B>Released version 1.0.4</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>October 9, 2002</B>: More FreeBSD configuration changes, support
for the GCC-ims <TT>__signed</TT> and <TT>__volatile</TT>. Thanks to Axel
Simon for pointing out these problems. <B>Released version 1.0.3</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>October 8, 2002</B>: FreeBSD configuration and porting fixes.
Thanks to Axel Simon for pointing out these problems. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 10, 2002</B>: Fixed bug in conversion to CIL. Now we drop
all &#8220;const&#8221; qualifiers from the types of locals, even from the fields of
local structures or elements of arrays.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 7, 2002</B>: Extended visitor interface to distinguish visitng
 offsets inside lvalues from offsets inside initializer lists.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 7, 2002</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.1</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 6, 2002</B>: Extended the patcher with the <TT>ateof</TT> flag.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 4, 2002</B>: Fixed bug in the elaboration to CIL. In some
cases constant folding of <TT>||</TT> and <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> was computed wrong.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>September 3, 2002</B>: Fixed the merger documentation. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 29, 2002</B>: <B>Released version 1.0.0.</B>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 29, 2002</B>: Started numbering versions with a major nubmer,
minor and revisions. Released version 1.0.0.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 25, 2002</B>: Fixed the implementation of the unique
identifiers for global variables and composites. Now those identifiers are
globally unique.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 24, 2002</B>: Added to the machine-dependent configuration the
<TT>sizeofvoid</TT>. It is 1 on gcc and 0 on MSVC. Extended the implementation of
<TT>Cil.bitsSizeOf</TT> to handle this (it was previously returning an error when
trying to compute the size of <TT>void</TT>).
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 24, 2002</B>: Changed the representation of structure and
unions to distinguish between undefined structures and those that are defined
to be empty (allowed on gcc). The sizeof operator is undefined for the former
and returns 0 for the latter.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 22, 2002</B>: Apply a patch from Richard H. Y. to support
FreeBSD installations. Thanks, Richard!
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>August 12, 2002</B>: Fixed a bug in the translation of wide-character
strings. Now this translation matches that of the underlying compiler. Changed
the implementation of the compiler dependencies.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 25, 2002</B>: Added interpreted constructors and destructors.
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 17, 2002</B>: Changed the representation of functions to move the
&#8220;inline&#8221; information to the varinfo. This way we can print the &#8220;inline&#8221;
even in declarations which is what gcc does. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 15, 2002</B>: Changed the visitor for initializers to make two
tail-recursive passes (the second is a <TT>List.rev</TT> and only done if one of
the initializers change). This prevents <TT>Stack_Overflow</TT> for large
initializers. Also improved the processing of initializers when converting to
CIL. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 15, 2002</B>: Changed the front-end to allow the use of <TT>MSVC</TT>
mode even on machines that do not have MSVC. The machine-dependent parameters
for GCC will be used in that case. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 11, 2002</B>: Changed the representation of formals in function
types. Now the function type is purely functional. 
<LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>May 4, 2002</B>: Added the function
