                The Compcert verified compiler

OVERVIEW:

The Compcert verified compiler is a compiler for a large subset of the
C programming language that generates code for the PowerPC, ARM and x86
processors.

The distinguishing feature of Compcert is that it has been formally
verified using the Coq proof assistant: the generated assembly code is
formally guaranteed to behave as prescribed by the semantics of the
source C code.

Compcert is an ongoing research project.  The present release is an
advanced prototype intended for research, educational and evaluation
purposes.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:

- PowerPC / MacOS   [stable]
    For Apple Macs running the MacOS 10.4, 10.5 or 10.6 operating system.
    Both PowerPC-based and Intel-based Macs are supported.
    The PowerPC code generated by the Compcert compiler runs
    natively at full speed on PowerPC-based Macs, and runs under
    software emulation at reduced speed on Intel-based Macs.

- PowerPC / Linux   [stable]
    For PowerPC machines running the Linux operating system.

- IA32 / Linux or MacOS or Windows+Cygwin  [stable]
   For Intel/AMD x86 processors with SSE2 extensions
   (i.e. Pentium 4 and later), running either Linux, MacOS 10.6 or 10.7,
   or Windows with the Cygwin environment (http://www.cygwin.com/).

- ARM / Linux       [experimental]
   For ARM machines running the Linux operating system.


PREREQUISITES:

* The "gcc", "as" and "make" tools must be installed and accessible in
  the search path.  For MacOS X, you can get them by installing the
  XCode development tools, as found on the installation DVDs
  or on http://developer.apple.com/.  For Microsoft Windows,
  install the Cygwin environment http://www.cygwin.com/.

* The Coq proof assistant, version 8.3pl1.
  Coq is free software, available from http://coq.inria.fr/
  The original version 8.3 is not compatible, nor any of the 8.2 versions.

* The Caml functional language, version 3.10 or later.
  Caml is free software, available from http://caml.inria.fr/

* Under MacOS, some standard C include files in /usr/include/
  contain gcc-isms that cause errors when compiling with CompCert.
  Symptoms include:
    - references to undefined types uint16_t and uint32_t
    - a type error when using the "assert" macro.
  These issues have been reported through Apple Developer's Connection.
  Until Apple fixes them, you can apply the patch available from
        http://compcert.inria.fr/release/MacOSX-includes.patch
  Download this file, then do:
     sudo /bin/bash
     cd /
     patch -p0 < ..../MacOSX-includes.patch


INSTALLATION:

1- Configure the system.  From the top directory, do:

             ./configure <target>

where <target> is one of:

            ppc-macosx       (PowerPC, MacOS X)
            ppc-linux        (PowerPC, Linux)
            ppc-eabi-unix    (PowerPC, EABI with Unix tools)
            ppc-eabi-diab    (PowerPC, EABI with Diab tools)
            arm-linux        (ARM, Linux)
            ia32-linux       (x86 SSE2 32 bits, Linux)
            ia32-macosx      (x86 SSE2 32 bits, MacOS X)
            ia32-cygwin      (x86 SSE2 32 bits, Cygwin environment for Windows)

This generates the Makefile.config file in the top directory.

The "configure" script accepts the following options:

-bindir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/bin)
        Directory where the binaries will be installed

-libdir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/lib/compcert)
        Directory where the Compcert support library will be installed
        (needed only under MacOS X)

-prefix <dir>                   (default: /usr/local)
        Set bindir and libdir to
        <dir>/bin and <dir>/lib/compcert, respectively.

2- Build the system.  From the top directory, do

             make all

This re-checks all the Coq proofs, then extracts Caml code from the
Coq specification and combines it with supporting hand-written Caml
code to generate the executable for Compcert.  This step takes 20
minutes or so on a recent machine; be patient.


3- You can now install Compcert.  This will create the "ccomp" command
in the binary directory selected during configuration, and install
supporting .h and .a files in the library directory.  Become superuser
if necessary and do

             make install


USAGE:

The executable for Compcert is called "ccomp".  It has the standard
command-line interface for a Unix C compiler.  For instance, to
compile the single-file program "src.c" and create an executable
called "exec", just do

       ccomp -o exec src.c

To compile a two-file program "src1.c" and "src2.c", do

       ccomp -c src1.c
       ccomp -c src2.c
       ccomp -o exec src1.o src2.o

To see the generated assembly code for "src1.c", do

       ccomp -S src1.c

The generated assembly code is left in file src1.s

The subset of the C language accepted by Compcert is quite large.
The main features of C that are not supported are:
  - The "long long" and "long double" types.
  - Non-structured forms of the "switch" statement (Duff's device).
  - Variable-argument functions.
The "ccomp" command will issue errors and diagnostics if it encounters
a C construct that it cannot process.

The "ccomp" command recognizes the following classes of input files:
  .c             C source file
  .cm            Cminor source file
  .s             Assembly file
  .S             Assembly file, to be run through the C preprocessor
  .o             Object code file
  .a             Library file

The "ccomp" command recognizes the following options:

  -E             Preprocess only, send result to standard output
