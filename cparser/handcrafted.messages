# This file contains a complete list of sentences that cause the pre_parser to
# detect an error.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# WORKFLOW:

# The workflow (when and how this file should be modified; which tools exist
# to maintain it; etc.) is documented in GNUmakefile in this directory.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FILE FORMAT:

# Each sentence is followed with a hand-written error message, which must be
# preceded and followed by a blank line.

# If several sentences should share a single error message, they can be grouped,
# with no whitespace between them.

# Hand-written comments, which begin with a single hash character, like this, are
# preserved when this file is updated by Menhir. Auto-generated comments, which
# begin with two hash characters, are re-generated by Menhir.

# An error message is basically free-form text. It cannot contain a blank line.
# Occurrences of the special form $i, where i is a number (an index into the
# parser's stack), will be replaced by the fragment of the source text that
# corresponds to this stack entry. It is the user's responsibility to ensure
# that the index i is within range, i.e., falls into the known suffix of the
# stack. Note that this index is 0-based and counts from right to left, i.e.,
# $0 refers to the RIGHTMOST stack cell.

# The replacement text for $i can be quite long (up to one line, basically)
# so one should avoid using several $i on a single line, unless one knows
# a smaller bound on their length.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CONVENTIONS ABOUT THE FORM AND STYLE OF ERROR MESSAGES:

# If possible, start with "Ill-formed foo", where "foo" is the thing that we
# are trying to recognize, i.e., the left-hand side of our items. This is not
# always possible, as we do not always know with certainty what we are trying
# to rcognize.

# If possible, say "Up to this point, a bar has been recognized", and show it,
# by using $i.

# If the current state was reached via spurious reductions, print a hypothesis,
# of the form "If this bar is complete, then".

# Show a list of the permitted continuations: "at this point, one of the
# following is expected:". The list should be complete, although unlikely
# continuations can be omitted. A continuation can be just one symbol, or
# a sequence of symbols.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTE ON THE CONTEXT OF AN EXPRESSION:

# A C expression occurs in many contexts.

# Although we could distinguish between these contexts statically, by adding a
# phantom parameter to all of the nonterminal symbols that encode expressions,
# that would be quite heavy: the number of states in the automaton would grow
# quite dramatically.

# Instead, we prefer to dynamically distinguish between these contexts. We do
# so in a very simple way: we give %on_error_reduce declarations to Menhir (in
# pre_parser.mly) so as to replace certain error actions with reduction actions.
# Thus, when Menhir finds an error and whatever is on the stack can be reduced
# to an expression, the automaton will reduce it to an expression. By carrying
# out this extra (spurious) reduction, the automaton ends up in a state where
# sufficient static context is available to tell what should follow. Thus,
# without doing anything special beyond giving these directives, we are able
# to sidestep the issue of the context of expressions.

# Of course, we must be careful to say (in our error messages) "IF this
# expression (or list of expressions) is complete, THEN the following
# continuations are expected". The weakness of this approach is that if the
# expression is NOT complete (in the user's mind), then we do not help the user
# understand how the expression should be completed. Our error message exhibits
# a bias towards ending expressions.

# OTHER USES OF %on_error_reduce:

# We apply this technique also to attribute_specifier_list and declarator. This
# means, intuitively, that when we find an error at a position where an
# attribute specifier list and/or a declarator could be complete, but could also
# be continued, we implicitly assume it is complete. Again, this must be taken
# into account in messages where an attribute_specifier_list or a declarator has
# just been recognized.

# ABOUT STRICT VERSUS LAX INTERPRETATIONS OF %on_error_reduce:

# There are two ways in which Menhir could implement %on_error_reduce. In the
# strict interpretation, an extra reduction takes place only if this is the
# only reduction that can take place in this state. (Thus, we do not choose
# between two interpretations of the past.) In the lax interpretation, an extra
# reduction can take place even if some other reduction is enabled. (In a
# situation where two extra reductions compete, neither takes place.)

# Adopting the lax interpretation adds more extra reductions, causing some
# error states to disappear. For instance, this state, where we have a read
# a VAR_NAME which could be either the beginning of an expression or the
# beginning of a labeled statement:

# general_identifier -> PRE_NAME VAR_NAME . [ COLON ]
# primary_expression -> PRE_NAME VAR_NAME . [ <lots of tokens> ]

# In the strict interpretation, no extra reduction is permitted here, because
# two reductions are enabled. In the lax interpretation, because we have 
# declared %on_error_reduce primary_expression, the second production is
# reduced. Hence, we implicitly assume that this name forms an expression
# (as opposed to a label). This is slightly inaccurate (we lose completeness)
# but removes an error state that is rather unpleasant.

# Even though it may sound "bad" to arbitrarily force one reduction among
# several possible reductions, one should keep in mind that an arbitrary
# choice is already made for us by the user when he "chooses" the incorrect
# token. Indeed, depending on which incorrect token is used, we may fall
# within or outside of a lookahead set, so we may make different reduction
# choices, and give different error messages. So, we shouldn't feel too bad
# about forcing a few more arbitrary choices. This is actually more regular,
# in a sense.

# In another instance of this phenomemon, there is a rather tricky state,
# where we have read "int f" at the toplevel, and we do not know whether this
# will be a variable definition (declarator) or a function definition
# (direct_declarator). In the lax interpretation, because we have declared
# %on_error_reduce declarator, we implicitly assume this must be the
# beginning of a declarator. Again, we lose completeness (we will not suggest
# that an opening parenthesis would have been accepted) but this makes our
# life easier, and does not sound too bad.

# Another instance is a state where we have read "enum foo". This could be a
# complete enum_specifier, or it could be continued with an opening brace. If it
# is complete, though, we lack static context to tell what should come after it.
# Using lax %on_error_reduce enum_specifier allows us to force a reduction,
# (thus forgetting that an opening brace would have been permitted) and to move
# to another state where more contextual information is available. As noted
# above, this reduction can already take place naturally, depending on the
# lookahead token, so we are only adding more cases where it takes place.

# The lax %on_error_reduce is used also to deal with a family of error states
# where we have recognized a complete statement which could be continued with an
# ELSE branch. These error states are difficult to explain: although we can
# definitely say that ELSE is permitted, we have difficulty telling what else is
# permitted, by lack of static context. We could recover this static information
# by introducing a phantom parameter on statements, but that would be heavy. We
# just cut a corner and use %on_error_reduce to view this as a complete
# statement. Thus, we abandon the possibility that the statement could be
# continued with ELSE: our error message will not mention it. Again, this makes
# our life easier, and does not sound too bad.

# We also apply %on_error_reduce to specifier_qualifier_list and
# option(abstract_declarator(type_name)). This allows us to recognize
# a valid type name, even when this type name could be continued. This
# allows us to go back to a state where we see the opening parenthesis
# before the type name (there is always one), which allows us to
# explain why we request a closing parenthesis. This is a bit costly,
# as there are quite a few similar error states to deal with here.

#     function specifiers,
#     possibly type specifiers,
# possibly followed with a TYPEDEF keyword.

# Note that we can get here via spurious reductions (e.g. "enum foo" can
# be considered a complete enum_specifier, hence a complete type_specifier).
# Thus, the list of permitted continuations below can be slightly incomplete:
# an opening brace could be used to continue "enum foo".

# Let's NOT mention the possibility of placing TYPEDEF somewhere in the middle.
# This means we pretend to be definitely in a declaration_specifiers(declaration).
# In other words, we are in the beginning of a declaration of function definition
# (we do not know which, yet).

# Let's also ignore the possibility of writing INLINE *after* the result type,
# which sounds awkward.

# If this declaration_specifiers is complete,
# then we expect:
#   init_declarator_list? SEMICOLON          if this is a declaration;
#   declarator                               if this is a function definition.

# We simplify "a list of init declarators" to "an init declarator".

# Our message is probably too elaborate; we could omit certain elements,
# or try to simplify our description in the case of a function definition.

Ill-formed declaration or function definition.
At this point, one of the following is expected:
