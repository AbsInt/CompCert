(** ** Expressions *)

(** Compcert C expressions are almost identical to those of C.

  as derived forms: array indexing, pre-increment, pre-decrement, and
  the [&&] and [||] operators.  All expressions are annotated with
  their types. *)

(** Expressions are implicitly classified into l-values and r-values,
ranged over by [l] and [r], respectively, in the grammar above.

L-values are those expressions that can occur to the left of an assignment.
They denote memory locations.  (Indeed, the reduction semantics for
expression reduces them to [Eloc b ofs] expressions.)  L-values are
variables ([Evar]), pointer dereferences ([Ederef]), field accesses ([Efield]).
R-values are all other expressions.  They denote values, and the reduction
semantics reduces them to [Eval v] expressions.

A l-value can be used in a r-value context, but this use must be marked
explicitly with the [Evalof] operator, which is not materialized in the
concrete syntax of C but denotes a read from the location corresponding to
the l-value [l] argument of [Evalof l].

The grammar above contains some forms that cannot appear in source terms
but appear during reduction.  These forms are:
- [Eval v] where [v] is a pointer or [Vundef].  ([Eval] of an integer or
  float value can occur in a source term and represents a numeric literal.)
- [Eloc b ofs], which appears during reduction of l-values.
- [Eparen r tycast ty], which appears during reduction of conditionals
  [r1 ? r2 : r3] as well as sequential `and' / `or'.

Some C expressions are derived forms.  Array access [r1[r2]] is expressed
as [*(r1 + r2)].
*)

  Ederef (Ebinop Oadd r1 r2 (Tpointer ty noattr)) ty.

(** Pre-increment [++l] and pre-decrement [--l] are expressed as
    [l += 1] and [l -= 1], respectively. *)

(** ** Statements *)

(** Compcert C statements are very much like those of C and include:
- empty statement [Sskip]
- evaluation of an expression for its side-effects [Sdo r]
- conditional [if (...) { ... } else { ... }]
- the three loops [while(...) { ... }] and [do { ... } while (...)]
  and [for(..., ..., ...) { ... }]
- the [switch] construct
- [break], [continue], [return] (with and without argument)
- [goto] and labeled statements.

Only structured forms of [switch] are supported; moreover,
the [default] case must occur last.  Blocks and block-scoped declarations
are not supported. *)

(** ** Functions *)

(** A function definition is composed of its return type ([fn_return]),
  the names and types of its parameters ([fn_params]), the names
  and types of its local variables ([fn_vars]), and the body of the
  function (a statement, [fn_body]). *)

  | Internal fd => type_of_function fd
  | External id args res cc => Tfunction args res cc
  end.

(** ** Programs and compilation units *)

(** As defined in module [Ctypes], a program, or compilation unit, is
  composed of:
- a list of definitions of functions and global variables;
- the names of functions and global variables that are public (not static);
- the name of the function that acts as entry point ("main" function).
- a list of definitions for structure and union names
- the corresponding composite environment
- a proof that this environment is consistent with the definitions. *)
