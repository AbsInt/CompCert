- Support for "aligned" and "section" attributes on global variables, e.g.
    __attribute__((aligned(16))) int x;

- Experimental emulation of packed structs (flag -fpacked-structs).

- Pointer comparisons now treated as unsigned comparisons (previously: signed).
  This fixes an issue with arrays straddling the 0x8000_0000 boundary.
  Consequently, the "ofs" part of pointer values "Vptr b ofs" is
  now treated as unsigned (previously: signed).

- Elimination of unreferenced labels now performed by a separate pass
  (backend/CleanupLabels.v) and proved correct.

- Stacking pass revised: supports more flexible layout of the stack
  frame; two-step proof (Stackingproof + Machabstr2concr) merged
  into one single proof (Stackingproof).

- The requirement that pointers be valid in pointer comparisons
  was pushed through all intermediate languages of the back-end
  (previously: requirement present only up to Csharpminor).

- Improvements to the compiler driver:
    .  -E option now prints preprocessed result to standard output
       instead of saving it in a .i file
    .  support for .s (assembly) and .S (assembly to be preprocessed)
       input files


Release 1.8.1, 2011-03-14
=========================

- Adapted to Coq 8.3pl1.

- Reduced compilation times through several algorithmic improvements
  (contributed by A. Pilkiewicz).

- In the various semantics, allow float-to-int conversions to fail
  (if the float argument is outside the range of representable ints).

- Initialization of global C variables made more robust and proved correct.

- ABI conformance improved:
     . the "char" type is now signed for x86, remains unsigned for PowerPC and ARM
     . placement of bit-fields now follows SVR4 conventions (affects PowerPC)

- Bug fixes in the C pre-simplifier:
     . nontermination with some recursive struct types
     . issues with zero-width bit fields
     . elimination of struct assignments duplicating some volatile accesses


Release 1.8, 2010-09-21
=======================

- The input language to the proved part of the compiler is no longer
  Clight but CompCert C: a larger subset of the C language supporting
  in particular side-effects within expressions.  The transformations
  that pull side effects out of expressions and materialize implicit
  casts, formerly performed by untrusted Caml code, are now fully
  proved in Coq.

- New port targeting Intel/AMD x86 processors.  Generates 32-bit x86 code
  using SSE2 extensions for floating-point arithmetic.  Works under
  Linux, MacOS X, and the Cygwin environment for Windows.
  CompCert's compilation strategy is not a very good match for the
  x86 architecture, therefore the performance of the generated code
  is not as good as for the PowerPC port, but still usable.
  (About 75% of the performance of gcc -O1 for x86, compared with
   > 90% for PowerPC.)

- More faithful semantics for volatile accesses: 
  . volatile reads and writes from a volatile global variable are treated
    like input and output system calls (respectively), bypassing
    the memory model entirely;
  . volatile reads and writes from other locations are treated like
    regular loads and stores.

- Introduced __builtin_memcpy() and __builtin_memcpy_words(), use them
  instead of memcpy() to compile struct and union assignments.

- Introduced __builtin_annotation() to transmit assertions from
  the source program all the way to the generated assembly code.

- Elimination of some useless casts around "&", "|" and "^" bitwise operators.

- Produce fewer "moves" during RTL generation.  This speeds up the
  rest of compilation and slightly improves the result of register
  allocation when register pressure is high.

- Improvements in register allocation:
  . Implemented a spilling heuristic during register allocation.
    This heuristic reduces significantly the amount of spill code
    generated when register pressure is high.
  . More coalescing between low-pressure and high-pressure variables.
  . Aggressive coalescing between pairs of spilled variables.

- Fixed some bugs in the emulation of bit fields.

	
Release 1.7.1, 2010-04-13
=========================

Bug fixes in the new C pre-simplifier:
- Missing cast on return value for some functions
- Incorrect simplification of some uses of || and &&
- Nontermination in the presence of a bit field of size exactly 32 bits.
- Global initializers for structs containing bit fields.
- Wrong type in volatile reads from variables of type 'unsigned int'.

Small improvements to the PowerPC port:
- Added __builtin_trap() built-in function.
- Support for '#pragma reserve_register' (EABI)
- Less aggressive alignment of global variables.
- Generate '.type' and '.size' directives (EABI).


Release 1.7, 2010-03-31
=======================

- New implementation of the C type-checker, simplifier, and translation to
  Clight.  Compared with the previous CIL-based solution, the new
  implementation is more modular and supports more optional simplifications.

- More features of the C language are handled by expansion during
  translation to Clight:
    . assignment between structs and unions (option -fstruct-assign)
    . passing structs and union by value (option -fstruct-passing)
    . bit-fields in structs (option -fbitfields)

- The "volatile" modifier is now honored.  Volatile accesses are represented
  in Clight by calls to built-in functions, which are preserved throughout
  the compilation chain, then turned into processor loads and stores
  at the end.

- Generic support for C built-in functions.  These predefined external
  functions give access to special instructions of the processor.  See
  powerpc/CBuiltins.ml for the list of PowerPC built-in functions.

- The memory model now exposes the bit-level in-memory representation
  of integers and floats.  This strengthens the semantic preservation
  theorem: we now prove that C code that directly manipulates these
  bit-level representations (e.g. via a union between floats and integers)
  is correctly compiled.

- The memory model now supports fine-grained access control to individual
  bytes of a memory block.  This feature is currently unused in the 
  compiler proofs, but will facilitate connections with separation logics
  later.

- External functions are now allowed to read and modify memory.
  The semantic preservation proofs were strengthened accordingly.
  In particular, this enables the malloc() and free() C library functions
  to be modeled as external functions in a provably correct manner.

- Minor improvements in the handling of global environments and the
  construction of the initial memory state.

- Bug fixes in the handling of '#pragma section' and '#pragma set_section'.

- The C test suite was enriched and restructured.

	
Release 1.6, 2010-01-13
=======================

- Support Clight initializers of the form "int * x = &y;".

- Fixed spurious compile-time error on Clight initializers of the form
  "const enum E x[2] = { E_1, E_2 };".

- Produce informative error message if a 'return' without argument
  occurs in a non-void function, or if a 'return' with an argument
  occurs in a void function.

- Preliminary support for '#pragma section' and '#pragma set_section'.

- Preliminary support for small data areas in PowerPC code generator.

- Back-end: added support for jump tables; used them to compile
  dense 'switch' statements.

- PowerPC code generator: force conversion to single precision before
  doing a "store single float" instruction.


Release 1.5, 2009-08-28
=======================

- Support for "goto" in the source language Clight.

- Added small-step semantics for Clight.

- Traces for diverging executions are now uniquely defined;
  tightened semantic preservation results accordingly.

- Emulated assignments between structures 
  (during the C to Clight initial translation).

- Fixed spurious compile-time error on Clight statements of the form
  "x = f(...);" where x is a global variable.

- Fixed spurious compile-time error on Clight initializers where
  the initial value is the result of a floating-point computation
  (e.g. "double x = 3.14159 / 2;").

- Simplified the interface of the generic dataflow solver.

- Reduced running time and memory requirements for the constant propagation
  pass.

- Improved the implementation of George and Appel's graph coloring heuristic:
  runs faster, produces better results.

- Revised the implementation of branch tunneling.

- Improved modularization between processor-dependent and
  processor-independent parts.


Release 1.4.1, 2009-06-05
=========================

- Adapted to Coq 8.2-1.  No changes in functionality.

Release 1.4, 2009-04-20
=======================

- Modularized the processor dependencies in the back-end.

- Three target architectures are now supported:
       PowerPC / MacOS X       (most mature)
       PowerPC / EABI & Linux  (getting stable)
       ARM / Linux EABI        (still experimental)

- Added alignment constraints to the memory model.

- Clight: added support for conditional expressions (a ? b : c);
  removed support for array accesses a[i], now a derived form.

- C front-end: honor "static" modifiers on globals.

- New optimization over RTL: turning calls into tail calls when possible.

- Instruction selection pass: elimination of redundant casts following
  a memory load of a "small" memory quantity.

- Linearization pass: improved the linearization heuristic.

- Reloading pass: more economical use of temporaries.

- Back-end: removed "alloc heap" instruction; removed pointer validity
  checks in pointer comparisons.


Release 1.3, 2008-08-11
=======================

- Added "goto" and labeled statements to Cminor.  Extended RTLgen and
    its proof accordingly.

- Introduced small-step transition semantics for Cminor; used it in
    proof of RTLgen pass; proved consistency of Cminor big-step semantics
    w.r.t. transition semantics.

- Revised division of labor between the Allocation pass and the Reload pass.
    The semantics of LTL and LTLin no longer need to anticipate the passing
    of arguments through the conventional locations.

- Cleaned up Stacking pass: the positions of the back link and of
    the return address in the stack frame are no longer hard-wired
    in the Mach semantics.

- Added operator to convert from float to unsigned int; used it in C front-end

- Added flag -fmadd to control recognition of fused multiply-add and -sub

- Semantics of pointer-pointer comparison in Clight was incomplete:
    pointers within different blocks can now be compared using == or !=

- Addition integer + pointer is now supported in Clight.

- Improved instruction selection for complex conditions involving || and &&.

- Improved translation of Cminor "switch" statements to RTL decision trees.

- Fixed error in C parser and simplifier related to "for" loops with
    complex expressions as condition.

- More benchmark programs in test/


Release 1.2, 2008-04-03
=======================

- First public release
