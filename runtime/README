This is the support library for CompCert-generated code.

It provides helper functions for:
- 64-bit integer arithmetic
- implementing the va_arg macro from <stdarg.h>

The implementation is written in assembly language in the
arm/ powerpc/ powerpc64/ riscV/ x86_32/ x86_64/ directories.

The c/ directory contains a C implementation of the 64-bit integer functions.
It is provided for reference and as a guide for the asm implementations.
